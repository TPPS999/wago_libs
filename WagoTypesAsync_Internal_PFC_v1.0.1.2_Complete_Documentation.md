## SchedulingMode (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | SchedulingMode | eSchedulingMode |  |
| Input | eEvent | eSchedulingModeEvent | device specific scheduling mode |

```
VAR
   eSchedMode := eSchedulingMode; // regular scheduling mode from WagoTypesCommon.library
END_VAR

eSchedMode := SchedulingMode(eSchedulingModeEvent.Modbus_Watchdog_Expired);  // Device specific mode
eSchedMode := eSchedulingMode.Background;                                    // Regular mode
```

```
eSchedMode := eSchedulingModeEvent.Modbus_Watchdog_Expired;  // Device specific mode
```

Casts a device specific scheduling mode into a generic scheduling mode.

Note: Technically, the direct assignment

would also work as intended, but it would produce a warning message. This warning is avoided by using this typecasting function.

## SchedulingMode_EventPriority (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | SchedulingMode_EventPriority | eSchedulingMode |  |
| Input | eEvent | eSchedulingModeEvent | device specific event id |
| ePrio | eSchedulingMode | desired priority |

```

Casts a device specific scheduling mode into a generic scheduling mode.

In extension to the type-casting function SchedulingMode() , this one allows for specification of an additional priority.

### Global Variable Lists


## AsyncInternalConst (GVL)


| Scope | Name | Type | Initial | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constant | EventModePitch | eSchedulingMode | 16#40 |  |
| PrioritySchedMask | DWORD | 16#3F |  |
| EventSchedMask | DWORD | 16#FFFFFFC0 |  |
| LowestFreeRunning | eSchedulingMode | eSchedulingMode.RealTimeHigh | 1 |
| HighestFreeRunning | eSchedulingMode | eSchedulingMode.Background | 15 |

Specific constants for number ranges.

Attention: when defining new priorities, the upper two values of the range [0..PrioritySchedMask] MUST NOT be used because those values are reserved for special purposes.

(In this case ths would be 16#3E and 16#3F.)

For attaching tasks to specific events.

These events are an extension to eSchedulingMode. Wherever a eSchedulingMode is expected, one of the modes enumerated below can also be used.

Note: To avoid warnings about the enumeration type, a type casing function SchedulingMode() or SchedulingMode_EventPriority() should be involved:

These type casting functions are also provided by this library.
