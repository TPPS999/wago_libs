## FuSqlite3_Finalize (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return | FuSqlite3_Finalize | DINT |
| Input | pSqlite3Stmt | POINTER TO typSQLite3_Stmt |

Destroy A Prepared Statement Object

The FuSqlite3_Finalize() function is called to delete a prepared statement. If the most recent evaluation of the statement encountered no errors or if the statement is never been evaluated, then FuSqlite3_Finalize() returns gc_SQLITE_OK . If the most recent evaluation of statement S failed, then FuSqlite3_Finalize(S) returns the appropriate error code or extended error code.

The FuSqlite3_Finalize() routine can be called at any point during the life cycle of prepared statement S: before statement S is ever evaluated, after one or more calls to FuSqlite3_Reset() , or after any call to FuSqlite3_Step() regardless of whether or not the statement has completed execution.

The application must finalize every prepared statement in order to avoid resource leaks. It is a grievous error for the application to try to use a prepared statement after it has been finalized. Any use of a prepared statement after it has been finalized can result in undefined and undesirable behavior such as segfaults and heap corruption.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | FuSqlite3_Open | DINT |  |
| Input | sFilename | STRING(256) | Database filename |
| pSqlite3 | POINTER TO typSQLite3 | SQLite db handle |

Opens A New Database Connection

A database connection handle is returned in pSqlite3, even if an error occurs. The only exception is that if SQLite is unable to allocate memory to hold the sqlite3 object, a NULL will be written into pSqlite3->SQLite3 instead of a pointer to the sqlite3 object. If the database is opened (and/or created) successfully, then gc_SQLITE_OK is returned. Otherwise an error code is returned. The FuSqlite3_Errmsg() routine can be used to obtain an English language description of the error following a failure of any of the FuSqlite3_Open() routine.

Compiling An SQL Statement

To execute an SQL statement, it must first be compiled into a byte-code program using this routine. Or, in other words, this routine is a constructor for the prepared statement object.

The first argument, pSqlite3 , is a database connection obtained from a prior successful call to FuSqlite3_Open() . The database connection must not have been closed.
