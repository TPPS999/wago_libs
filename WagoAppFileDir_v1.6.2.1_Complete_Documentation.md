Channelled Trigger-model with oStatus .

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This base model is completely identical to â€˜WagoChannelledTriggerâ€™ with the only difference that the trigger variable and the status output are named slightly differently here.

It is composed of two separated sub-modules:

Protected methods

The user of this Model has to re-implement the methods of this interface according to his needs. These methods are PUBLIC for technical reasons only, while semantically they are to be treated as PROTECTED, as is usual for the other models. Do not call them directly.

The property IsInitialCycle which is provided in other models is re-implemented twice for use in the pseudo-protected methods. One is named IsInitialChannelCycle, the other is named IsInitialTriggerCycle. They reflect the states of the corresponding parts.

Result Codes

The expected result codes for the Pseudo-PROTECTED methods are identical to those in the description of the individual components (WagoChannel and WagoTxTrigger):

Attention: The derived child FB has to call SUPER^(xTxTrigger:=xTxTrigger); in its body.

Graphical Illustration ![Image](images/wagoappfiledir_af3c6d28.png) Function Description This base model is completely identical to â€˜WagoChannelledTriggerâ€™ with the only difference that the trigger variable and the status output are named slightly differently here. It is composed of two separated sub-modules: Channel: This part controls the opening and closing of an associated communication channel. The description of WagoChannel applies to this part. Please note that any parameters for opening the channel (such as filenames, ip-addresses, COM-ports, etc) only apply to FBs which are derived from this model, and not to this base model itself. Trigger: This part controls the transmission of data. The description of WagoTxTrigger directly applies to it. The TxTrigger part is only active while the Channel -Part is open. Otherwise the main runner is not called. Protected methods The user of this Model has to re-implement the methods of this interface according to his needs. These methods are PUBLIC for technical reasons only, while semantically they are to be treated as PROTECTED, as is usual for the other models. Do not call them directly.

Function Description

The â€˜sDestinationNameâ€™ may denote a file name or a directory name, in which case the name of the file remains the same and only the path changes.

If the new file name needs the creation of parent directories, these will be created.

If the destination file already exists, this function fails with EEXIST unless the xOverwrite flag is set. In that case, this function tries to delete the existing file. If deletion fails, the function will again fail with EEXIST.

Scans a directory and retrieves informations about its contents.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

When the last entry has been read or the directory is empty, the following Read() returns ENODATA. Special system entries, such as â€˜.â€™ and â€˜..â€™ are generally skipped. Please note that this FB scans only one hierarchical level of the directory, i.e. the contents of subdirectories are not scanned.

The returned data is returned as typFileProperties .

If some of these properties are not supported by the addressed file system, they carry a reasonable default value. E.g. for non-windows file systems, the xArchive flag will always be FALSE if the file system does not contain such an attribute.

Asynchronous Behaviour:

The methods Open(), Read(), and Close() will return immediately, but they leave their jobs in the asynchronous domain, which is indicated by the output xBusy .

While xBusy is TRUE no further methods must be called.

The termination of the asynchronous execution is indicated by xTerminated . The read data structure, eResult , and other outputs are valid only after xTerminated is TRUE.

Reads the contents of a directory sequentially.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This FB reads a directory sequentially and delivers the status of each directory entry into a typed buffer space â€˜typFilePropertiesâ€™ .

It implements the behaviour model â€˜WagoChannelledTriggerâ€™ , i.e. a transition from FALSE to TRUE at the input xOpen starts the reading process. With the falling edge of xOpen the FB is closed again.

Once the FB is open, each FALSE to TRUE transition will fill the result buffer â€˜typPropertyBufferâ€™ with the properties of the next entry in the directory. System entries as â€˜.â€™ and â€˜..â€™ will be skipped.

A TRUE at the output xEofReached indicates that all entries of a directory have been read. After this point, further xTrigger edges will deliver empty result buffers and the code ENODATA at the status output.

Base FB for file handling with comprehensive functionality.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

As all functions are triggered using methods, this FB has no dedicated input variables.

Example: Writing some data into a file

Interface variables Function Base FB for file handling with comprehensive functionality. Graphical Illustration ![Image](images/wagoappfiledir_b04f0fcc.png) Function Description As all functions are triggered using methods, this FB has no dedicated input variables. Usage: 1. File operations are initiated by trigger methods Open(), Close(), Write(), etc which also deliver parameters to the FbGeneralFile. 2. When these Functions are called, the underlying functionality is carried out in the background and the trigger methods return immediately. The application has to cyclically observe xTerminated in order to determine whether the triggered functionality has been completed or not. While xBusy is TRUE , all further triggering calls are rejected with EBUSY. 3. Results of the operations are delivered at the outputs of the FB, after xTerminated is set. Example: Writing some data into a file - FbGeneralFile.Close (METH) - FbGeneralFile.GetPos (METH) - FbGeneralFile.Open (METH) - FbGeneralFile.Read (METH) - FbGeneralFile.ReadByte (METH) - FbGeneralFile.ReadString (METH) - FbGeneralFile.Seek (METH) - FbGeneralFile.Write (METH) - FbGeneralFile.WriteByte (METH) - FbGeneralFile.WriteString (METH)

Modular FB for opening a file.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This FB implements the behaviour model â€˜WagoExecuteâ€™ .

With the rising edge of xExecute, the file is opened in a mode defined by the input parameters. Please, refer to the section â€˜Type Definitionâ€™ or to the library WagoTypesCommon for details about file modes. (The input xExclusive prepares this FB for a future feature. It must always be FALSE.)

Modular FBs in this section are designed to each represent each a single operation step with each instance. The â€˜xDoneâ€™ output of the first instance triggers the execution of the following instance. Thus we finally get a chain of steps which is processed virtually sequentially, as shown in the following example.

Please note that for production code appropriate error handling should be provided which is not shown here.

Chain of modular FBs

The in-out variable â€˜Instanceâ€™ must be connected to an instance of an FbGeneralFile (FB) . The body of that â€˜Instanceâ€™ must be operated cyclically, but no further stimulus to this Instance need be applied,because the modular FBs will take care of this internally. All FBs in such a â€˜chainâ€™ as indicated in the figure above must be connected to the same â€˜Instanceâ€™-FB.

This FB implements the behaviour model â€˜WagoExecuteâ€™ , as explained in more detail in FbGeneralFile_Open_mod (FB) . On the rising edge of the input xExecute the FB sets the file pointer to a new position.

The file pointer is an internal structure which determines the location inside a file from where data is read or where data is written to.

The desired new position is given by the input liPos. This number is either relative to the start of the file, or relative to the current end of the file or relative to the current file pointer position. The input whence (type eSeekMode , defined in WagoTypesCommon) determines which reference is used here.

Function Description

This FB reads a whole file into a buffer.

It implements the behaviour model â€˜WagoTriggerâ€™ , i.e. a transition to TRUE on xTrigger triggers the read process. The FB resets xTrigger to FALSE again, after it has finished its read process.

If the file fits into the given buffer, the output udiRxNBytes indicates the size of the file and xEofReached is set to TRUE. If the given buffer is too small, only the beginning of the file is read and the output xEofReached remains FALSE. It is not possible to read file contents successively with this FB.

Compact FB for reading a binary file.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This FB reads a file in consecutive blocks.

It implements the behaviour model â€˜WagoChannelledTriggerâ€™ :

While the Input xOpen is TRUE , the file is kept open. This state is reflected by the output xIsOpen .

The output xIsIdle indicates that the FB is ready for opening the file. While xIsIdle is FALSE and xIsOpen is also FALSE , the FB is in some transient state, e.g. in the process of opening or closing a file. xOpen should only be changed from FALSE to TRUE if xIsIdle is TRUE.

With the falling edge of xOpen the file is closed again.

A FALSE to TRUE transition on the input xTrigger initiates a read process from the open file. The inputs pRxBuffer and udiRxBufferSize specify a buffer space for the read data.

The output udiRxNBytes indicates how many bytes are actually read. This is normally the same as udiRxBufferSize, but if the end of the file was reached, it could be less.

The output xEofReached denotes that the end of the file has been reached by the last read process. It is raised to TRUE just after the last byte of the file is read.

Compact FB for sequentially writing a file.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This FB opens a file in write mode and writes content to the file in consecutive blocks.

It implements the behaviour model â€˜WagoChannelledTriggerâ€™ : While the Input xOpen is TRUE , the file is kept open in â€˜FAM_Writeâ€™-mode. If the file existed previously, it will be erased. The open state is reflected by the output â€˜xIsOpenâ€™.

The output xIsIdle indicates that the FB is ready for opening the file. While xIsIdle is FALSE and xIsOpen is also FALSE , the FB is in some temporary state, e.g. in the process of opening or closing a file. xOpen should only be changed from FALSE to TRUE if xIsIdle is TRUE .

With the falling edge of xOpen the file is closed again.

A FALSE to TRUE transition on the input â€˜xTriggerâ€™ initiates a write process to the open file. The inputs â€˜pTxBufferâ€™ and â€˜udiTxNBytesâ€™ specify the location and the amount of the write data.

This library, WagoAppFileDir, provides real time access to the files and the file system of the PLC.

## General Interface of each FB


All functionalities of FBs in the Compact (cpt) and Modular (mod) section are wrapped in FBs which uniformly implement standard WAGO behaviour models, mostly WagoExecute for simple functionalities and the method oriented ones for more complex issues.

### Method oriented Interface


In the FbGeneralFile (FB) , for example, the xExecute-Input is replaced by a couple of specific trigger methods â€˜Open(filename,accesmode,...)â€™, â€˜Close()â€™, Write(content), Seek(where, whence), ..., which combine specific initializing and triggering in one method.

### Scheduling Mode


The parameter eSchedMode controls the scheduling priority of the FB, as described in WagoSysAsync.

Beside the main intention of this library to decouple long running work from the application task, all FBs can also be run synchronously if wanted, i.e. no other task is spawned and reaction time is minimum. Details of scheduling depend on the target hardware.

For a detailed description of the scheduling modes, please refer to â€˜eSchedulingModeâ€™ in WagoTypesCommon.

### Abortion


The functionalities Abort and Timeout provide an interface for cancelling the process prematurely. Please note that the effect of abortion is delayed internally until the aborted process has finished all non-interruptible activites.

The functionalities Abort and Timeout provide an interface for cancelling the process prematurely. Please note that the effect of abortion is delayed internally until the aborted process has finished all non-interruptible activites. 1. Direct abortion: When the applications calls the abort method, the FB will terminate with the errorcode ECANCELLED after it has reached the next point where abortion is possible. 1. Time-out: When applying xExecute , a time-out value is passed to the FB. When the applied amount of time is exceeded, an internal abortion is performed automatically. If â€˜0â€™ is passed to this input, no time-out will take place.

Nearly every method returns a status code eResultCode . On success it is always a â€˜0â€™.

Other functionalities, which 1.) return a single value and 2.) could not potentially fail are coincidentally quite simple and thus are designed as property-getters whenever possible.

There are also a methods which meet both of the above conditions but need additional input parameters or are not assigned to any instance of a function block (e.g. getWorkingDirectory()). These deliver their function result directly.

The list below directly reflects the result codes from POSIX. (operation return status, according to POSIX.1, 1996 edition, corresponding to â€˜errno.hâ€™).

Only a small subset (typically lower numbers) is actually used by the functions in this library.

Which subset of these codes is produced, and under which conditions, is defined in the context of each function or method (and stated in the header). Even when the underlying (hidden) hardware layers change their error behaviour, it is guaranteed that the published behaviour and the error codes at application level remain as stated.

The codes which are likely to appear within this library are:

The documentation of each function contains detailed informations about which codes appear under which circumstances.

## Not implemented functions


If the deployed hardware does not support certain functions, the errorcode ENOSYS (38, â€˜Function not implementedâ€™) is returned, so applications can retrieve knowledge about whether a function is implemented.

## Path and file notations


### Canonical Filenames and Pathnames


The canonical form of a filename is:

prefix could be e.g: - TEMP : A temporary file system which does not survive powercycles - HOME : Data which will survive power cycles - CARD : Files on removable media, such as sd-cards

The canonical form of a filename is: prefix://path/name prefix could be e.g: - TEMP : A temporary file system which does not survive powercycles - HOME : Data which will survive power cycles - CARD : Files on removable media, such as sd-cards

#### Prefix


The prefix will be translated internally into the appropriate hardware specific mount point, e.g. â€˜/media/card/â€™ or â€˜F:â€™ or other names. However, these interal names are hidden from the user in order to help implementing portable applications.

The prefix can be entered in lower case letters as well as in upper case letters (but not mixed). When the system returns a prefix (e.g. as a result of GetWorkingDirectory()), it will always return the nominal form, which is upper case for local media in order to resemble windows â€˜drive lettersâ€™, while it is lower case for remote drives in order to meet worldwide conventions.

#### Path


The â€˜//path/â€™ denotes the access path to the desired resource. Canonically it starts with a double slash â€˜//â€™ and ends with the last slash â€˜/â€™. If a path is expected and the last character is not a slash, then that last slash will be appended. If the entered path contains backslashes (â€˜\â€™), these will be translated into canonical slashes (â€˜/â€™). When the system returns paths, the path components are always separated by slashes (â€˜/â€™).

If the entered path contains backslashes (â€˜\â€™), these will be translated into canonical slashes (â€˜/â€™). When the system returns paths, the path components are always separated by slashes (â€˜/â€™).

#### Filename and path components


The filenames and pathes may or may not include dots (â€˜.â€™) for indicating intended file usage (e.g. â€˜report.csvâ€™). Components of filenames may contain zero, one, or more dots. For file usage indication (â€˜extensionâ€™) the substring behind the last dot (if any) is relevant. (â€˜logfile_1.3.4.43.txtâ€™)

Path components and filenames may not contain slashes or backslashes as part of their names, as these characters are reserved for separation of path components. Filenames or path components must not be empty. This ensures that the combination of two consecutive slashes (â€˜//â€™) will never appear at places other then between prefix and path.

#### Character Set


The usable character set for filename and path components is limited only by the target hardware, which means these components may contain every character except for slashes (â€˜/â€™), backslashes (â€˜\â€™) and reserved characters 0x00..0x1f.

The library will not check or modify other characters, but these characters might be rejected by the firmware, e.g. when a new file is to be created with characters in the name, which are not supported by the firmware.

This implicit dependency upon the target hardware is known and wanted, because we envisage special situations where filenames with strange characters are required by external IT-components.

This implicit dependency upon the target hardware is known and wanted, because we envisage special situations where filenames with strange characters are required by external IT-components.

#### Portability


In order to keep programs portable, however, we strongly recommend restricting the used character set for filenames to the following characters:

When codes in the range [0xa0..0xff] are needed, we highly recommend the use of UTF8-codes, because the use of 8-Bit character planes is a prominent point for portability issues. Codes in the range [0x80..0xbf] may lead to undefined results in other systems if used outside the context of UTF8 codes.

In order to enhance portability, target firmware (or corresponding target specific layers) may convert those characters which would otherwise not be supported into replacement characters (e.g. â€˜%20%â€™ instead of <space>), but this behaviour is not yet specified nor is it guaranteed, so the user cannot rely on it.

In order to keep programs portable, however, we strongly recommend restricting the used character set for filenames to the following characters: [A-Z][a-z][0-9]{â€˜_â€™, â€˜-â€˜, â€˜.â€™, â€˜+â€™, â€˜~â€™, â€˜=â€™, â€˜(â€˜, â€˜)â€™ } When codes in the range [0xa0..0xff] are needed, we highly recommend the use of UTF8-codes, because the use of 8-Bit character planes is a prominent point for portability issues.

### Other Forms of pathes and filenames


If a filename does not start with a prefix (e.g. â€˜CARD:â€™), then it is assumed that the name denotes either

Please note that the use of system dependant absolute paths leads to portability problems. Thus we strongly recommend using standard prefixes.

If a filename does not start with a prefix (e.g. â€˜CARD:â€™), then it is assumed that the name denotes either - a system dependant absolute path (starting with a slash, e.g. â€˜/media/card/log/actual.txtâ€™) which will be passed unconverted to the system or - a relative path (starting with no slash â€˜log/actual.txtâ€™) where the working directory will be added for translation. Please note that the use of system dependant absolute paths leads to portability problems. Thus we strongly recommend using standard prefixes.

Opens a file for reading and / or writing.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The method Open() specifies which file is to be accessed and the modalities of the intended access.

Open() must be called first before any other method of this FB can be successfully executed. If any access is attempted to an FbGeneralFile which has not been successfully opened, that method will reply EBADFD (â€˜Bad file number or file not openâ€™).

After the file operations have been finished, a corresponding Close() method should be called in order to terminate the FB regularly and to release the internal resources.

When Open() is applied to an already open file, the previously opened file will be closed and a regular Open() is performed in the now unassigned FB. (Note that the latter Open() call may fail, so the application might end up with a closed FB after trying to open an already open file FB.)

Note: The result code of the Open() method represents the success of scheduling the open() call itself, but not the success of the open procedure, because the latter is not known at the time of the call. The result code of successfully or unsuccessfully opening a file is represented by the xError-output of the FB after xTerminated has signalled termination.

The File can be opened in different access modes ( eAccMode : eFileAccessMode ). In all writable modes (not FAM_Read), the file will be created if it does not exist.

The third parameter controls the timing of write processes to the physical media ( eSyncMode : eFileSyncMode ).

On success, the FbGeneralFile transits to the state â€˜Openâ€™ and further operations (such as write, read, close) may be performed upon this instance.

Opening for exclusive usage:

The input â€˜xExclusiveâ€™ represents a feature for coordinating the simultaneous access to file resources from different FBs or even diffent tasks. Although it is currently not yet implemented, it is already contained in the interface in order not to have to change the complete interface later.

Until that future release, leave the input â€˜xExclusiveâ€™ at FALSE wherever it occurs.

Output after termination:

After asynchronous termination of Open() the FB has updated following outputs:

Function Description

Reads data from an open file.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This method reads data from an open file and delivers it to the buffer which is addressed by â€˜pRxBufferâ€™.

The input udiRxBufferSize denotes the desired amount of data, which is often the same as the buffer size. Normally, exactly this amount of data will be returned, but when the end of the file is encountered, less data will be returned (which is not an erroneous state).

Attention: The number of bytes actually read is not returned via the read() method, because that number is known only after the asynchronous execution. Instead it is returned via the FB output udiRxNBytes , which is valid after xTerminated indicates completion of the job.

If no data bytes could be read, i.e the end of the file is reached, read() will return ENODATA.

Note data can not only be read sequentially but also from arbitrary positions within the file when the seek() method is used.

Output after termination:

Function Description

This method reads bytes from a file until an end-of-line symbol is encountered and stores the result into the output sLine of the FB.

End-of-line could be <LF>, or a <CR>, or a combination of both - that will be detected automatically. The end-of-line-character(s) will not be included in the result string.

The parameter uiSize denotes the size of the string buffer. When the size of the logical line exceeds the size of the string buffer, the FB delivers ENOSPC. Valid values for uiSize are 1..255. Others will produce EINVAL.

This method is similar to Read(), but the amount of data actually read is represented as the length of the output string and it depends on the actual file contents.

| EINPROGRESS | The asynchronous process has been started, but has not yet terminated (temporary). |
| ECANCELED | Execution was terminated prematurely by applying Abort . |
| ETIMEDOUT | Execution terminated prematurely due to Time-out. |

Sets the filepointer to the desired position.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The position of the next read- or write-access to the file will be set to a new value. The desired position is given relative to either the beginning of the file (absolute positioning), to the end of the file (for writing data at the end of the file), or relative to the actual read/write position. That behaviour is controlled by the parameter whence : eSeekMode .

If the file pointer is set beyond the end of the file, the file will be filled up with zeroes on the next write() access. It will not be filled up without a write operation.

If the desired effective file position points to an address before the start of the file, the result of this operation is EACCES and the file pointer remains unchanged.

Output after termination:

After termination, the following outputs of the FB are relevant:

This method returns one of the codes shopwn below.

Known problems

The interface of this method allows for seamless usage on files without any limitations at 2GB or 4GB borders. The implementation of the filesystems in the firmware, however, may be limited to file sizes below 4GB (which is still quite suitable for the majority of applications). In these cases, a seek to an effective position beyond the 4GB-Limit will also return EACCES, because that position cannot be handled by the underlying hardware.
