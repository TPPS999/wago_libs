Timeout detection

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

After a given amount of time this FB indicates a timeout.

A timeout condition is normally indicated by the return value of the method HasTimeoutOccurred() . Additionally, at timeout a dedicated timeout action may be invoked (see below).

The reference point in time for determining timeouts is given by the system start or by calling one of the methods StartNow() or Retrigger().

Timeout will not occur, before the time limit value is set by one of the methods SetTimeout() or SetLTimeout().

When using StartNow() for starting, it is mandatory to call Set(L)Timeout afterwards for detecting a timeout. By using Retrigger() however, the previously set timeout limit will be re-used again.

(To be clear in this point: SetTimeout() will not start the measurement of the timeout-interval. Just the notification about the expiration of the timeout requires that this timeout value has been set. This value may also be changed during the runtime without disturbing the interval measurement.)

Typical usage

Additional Feature:

An object derived from â€˜WagoTypes.Fb_GenericRunnerâ€™ may be scheduled to be called when timeout has occurred. For doing so, the input variable â€˜pTimeoutActionâ€™ has to be set to the address of the instance of the runner object. In that case, the FbTimeoutWatcher must be called cyclically, while in other cases, the cyclic call may be omitted. On timeout, the method run() of that object will be called.

If that feature is not used, leave the input at its default (=0). In that case, just the HasTimeoutOccurred-Property is set and no further action is taken. Then, cyclic call of the FB may be ommitted.

## doc10_General (FB)


General Preface

This library contains functions, types definitions, and function blocks for handling time and timestamps of the system.

Handling of system time and RTC-time is merged to one unified absolute time here, so the user does not have to consider different time sources here.

Several general topics are covered:

Unconventionally, there are no different routines for realtime and systemtime in this library. This is because both are unified on Wago PLCs. The data type LTIME is used for both high resolution calculation and also for representing absolute time. Nevertheless, the standard types for time are of course also supported.

See below in the section â€˜Supplementary Notesâ€™ for more details.

Getting timestamps 2. Perform typical operations and conversions with them 3. Setting the system time (including implicitly setting the RTC). 4. Handling timezones and automatical switching of Daylight-Saving (DST) 5.

Supplementary Notes

### Different Sources of Time


In a modern processing environment, there are different internal sources for time information, namely the Real-Time-Clock (RTC), the CPU-Clock, perhaps also an external NTP connection to an atomic time standard. Each of these sources is subject to drifting apart from the readings of other sources. That situation would be a little bit difficult to handle for the final application programmer.

To overcome that problem, all time sources are combined by internal software layers to one single system time. The RTC for example serves for initial setting of the system time and for continuously adjusting the system time in order to keep it synchronized with the global world time. (Also an NTP connection might be employed for this purpose) The registers of the RTC are never read or written to directly, but only indirectly when modifying the combined system time.

The system time is guaranteed to increase monotonically and to be readjusted smoothly according to time references with high precision (such as RTC or an NTP connection).

When system time is set, the RTC is always also set immediately.

RTC and system time are allways kept internally in UT (i.e. GMT+0:00), not in local time, which makes it easy to smoothly adjust the system time. When the timezone is switched or DST is toggled, this operation operates only on a timezone offset.

### Data Types


In the context of handling time and date, a certain variety of data types has been established in the recent years, so it is worth getting a kind of overview about this issue.

We will concentrate on those data types, which give most benefit to the user.

#### TIME


Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned

Range: 0 .. 49 days, relative

Resolution: 1 millisecond

General application: Fast computation of short time intervals.

Application in this library: This type is used as standard type in this library.

Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned Range: 0 .. 49 days, relative Resolution: 1 millisecond General application: Fast computation of short time intervals. Attention: Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps. When this is required, the TIME value has to be converted to a signed type before further evaluation can take place. Application in this library: This type is used as standard type in this library.

#### DATE_AND_TIME


Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned

Range: year 1970..2106

Resolution: 1 second

Application: Representation of abslolute POSIX-Time

Differences of timestamps of this type are virtually useless , because Codesys compiles these differences into the type TIME, which will silently overflow at differences greater than 49 days. Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps anyway.

When computing differences is required, type conversion to signed 32-bit values has to be performed before computing the difference.

Application in this library: This type is used as standard type in this library.

Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned Range: year 1970..2106 Resolution: 1 second Application: Representation of abslolute POSIX-Time Attention (1): Strict compatibility to POSIX-Time is given only up to the year 2038 (POSIX-Time is signed). Attention (2): Differences of timestamps of this type are virtually useless , because Codesys compiles these differences into the type TIME, which will silently overflow at differences greater than 49 days. Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps anyway. When computing differences is required, type conversion to signed 32-bit values has to be performed before computing the difference. Application in this library: This type is used as standard type in this library.

#### LTIME


Implementation: 64-bit, unsigned

Range: 0 .. 584 years

Resolution: 1 nanosecond

Implementation: 64-bit, unsigned Range: 0 .. 584 years Resolution: 1 nanosecond Application: Handling of time intervals with high resolution. regarding the high data range, this type is also suitable to handle absolute time stamps beyond the limitations of POSIX-Time. When using this type with sign awareness, dates from year 1678 up to year 2262 can be represented. Attention: Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps. When this is required, the TIME value has to be converted to a signed type before further evaluation can take place. Application in this library: This type is used as standard type in this library. Its semantic is extended, as it will also be used for absolute represetation of date and time with nanosecond resolution. When interpreted as absolute value, it will be interpreted as time interval since 1.1.1970, resembling POSIX time and the standard type DATE_AND_TIME.

#### TIME_OF_DAY


Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned

Range: 0:00:00 .. 23:59:59.999

Resolution: 1 millisecond

Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned Range: 0:00:00 .. 23:59:59.999 Resolution: 1 millisecond Application: Representing the local time, but practically redundant , because TIME covers the same range and the same resolution without the restrictions of this data type and RTS_SYSTIMEDATE ist more appropriate when separarted time components are required. Attention: Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps. When this is required, the TIME value has to be converted to a signed type before further evaluation can take place. Application in this library: This type is not used in this library, because it makes sense only in calendarial contexts (where timezones are considered) and this field is covered by the structures typRTS_SYSTIMEDATE and typWagoTimeComponents.

#### DATE


Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned

Range: 1.1.1970 .. 7.2.2106

Resolution: 1 second

Attention (1): Strict compatibility to POSIX-Time is given only up to the year 2038 (POSIX-Time is signed)

Differences of timestamps if this type are virtually useless , because Codesys compiles these differences into the type TIME, which will silently overflow at differences greater than 49 days. Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps anyway.

When computing differences is required, type conversion to signed 32-bit values has to be performed before computing the difference.

Implementation: 32-bit, unsigned Range: 1.1.1970 .. 7.2.2106 Resolution: 1 second Application: Representing the local date. But it is practically redundant , because DATE_AND_TIME covers the same range and the same resolution without the restrictions of this data type. RTS_SYSTIMEDATE would be more appropriate when separated time components are required. Attention (1): Strict compatibility to POSIX-Time is given only up to the year 2038 (POSIX-Time is signed) Attention (2): Differences of timestamps if this type are virtually useless , because Codesys compiles these differences into the type TIME, which will silently overflow at differences greater than 49 days. Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps anyway. When computing differences is required, type conversion to signed 32-bit values has to be performed before computing the difference. Application in this library: This type is not used in this library, because it makes sense only in calendarial contexts (where timezones are considered) and this field is covered by the structures typRTS_SYSTIMEDATE and typWagoTimeComponents.

#### SYSTIME


Implementation: 64-bit, unsigned

Range: <not defined>

Resolution: 1 system clock (SysTimeCore.library)

Application: fast computing of positive time differences, absolute timestamps for internal purposes

Implementation: 64-bit, unsigned Range: <not defined> Resolution: 1 system clock (SysTimeCore.library) Application: fast computing of positive time differences, absolute timestamps for internal purposes Attention (1): The application of this type is pretty inconsistent in this library. In different places it represents either system ticks, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds. There is no uniform calculation from this data type to real dimensions e.g. â€˜secondsâ€™. Attention (2): Due to the lack of sign, this data type cannot handle general differences of timestamps. When this is required, the TIME value has to be converted to a signed type before further evaluation can take place. Application in this library: This type and its variations are ubiquitous on system level, but it is not used in this library, because it is defined too ambiguously.

#### RTS_SYSTIMEDATE


Implementation: Composed structure in SysTimeRtc.library.

Range: Year 1 .. year 65535

Resolution: 1 millisecond

When leaving UTC and going to local time, the representation of the local time becomes ambiguous: When switching from daylight-saving-time DST back to standard time, the local time happens to pass through two adjacent hours which are both called 2oâ€™clock but which are distinguished by calling them 02a:00 (DST) followed by 02b:00 (standard time), which is finally followed by 03:00.

There is no mechanism employed to distinguish between both 2 oâ€™clock hours, so when used for setting the local time, this type does not cover all posiibilites.

N.B.: Codesys conversions cover conversions from DATE_AND_TIME to UTC, but they regard conversions from and to local time as obsolete for this reason (but without telling any replacement).

Implementation: Composed structure in SysTimeRtc.library. Range: Year 1 .. year 65535 Resolution: 1 millisecond Application: Separation of different components of local timestamp (year, month, day, day of week) e.g. for printing purpose. This structure is not well suitable for further computing. Attention: When leaving UTC and going to local time, the representation of the local time becomes ambiguous: When switching from daylight-saving-time DST back to standard time, the local time happens to pass through two adjacent hours which are both called 2oâ€™clock but which are distinguished by calling them 02a:00 (DST) followed by 02b:00 (standard time), which is finally followed by 03:00. There is no mechanism employed to distinguish between both 2 oâ€™clock hours, so when used for setting the local time, this type does not cover all posiibilites. N.B.: Codesys conversions cover conversions from DATE_AND_TIME to UTC, but they regard conversions from and to local time as obsolete for this reason (but without telling any replacement). Attention (2): This type is defined in different ways in different versions of the base library, SysTimeRtc, so there is at the moment no way of portably extending this struct in child libraries. Application in this library: This type is not used directly in this library, because it is defined ambiguously within different versions of system libraries. It is used as template for a uniformly defined typRTS_SYSTIMEDATE .

#### typRTS_SYSTIMEDATE


Range: Year 1 .. year 65535

Resolution: 1 millisecond

Implementation: This is a struct where the components are defined in exactly the same way as in SysTimeRtc.RTS_SYSTIMEDATE or SysTimeRtc.SYSTIMEDATE resp. but which is declared without version ambiguities, so it is possible to portably extend this structure. For details see â€˜typRTS_SYSTIMEDATEâ€™ in the appendix â€˜Typesâ€™. Range: Year 1 .. year 65535 Resolution: 1 millisecond Application: Work around for providing a structure which can be used in exactly the same manner and with the same interface as the established (RTS_)SYSTIMEDATE, but without the ambiguity of versions. Other struct are derived from this base struct.

#### typWagoTimeComponents


```
VAR
  StandardTimeDate   : typRTS_SYSTIMEDATE;     // the standard type
  ExtendedComponents : typWagoTimeComponents;  // more detailed information
END_VAR

FUNCTION GetLocalTimeComponents : typWagoTimeComponents // delivers detail information

   [...]

ExtendedComponents := GetLocalTimeComponents();  // usage as declared
StandardTimeDate   := GetLocalTimeComponents();  // old types do also work together
                                                 // with Wago-functions.
```

Range: Year 1 .. year 65535

Resolution: 1 nanosecond

By this means, compatibility to legacy code which still needs the 3S-SysTimeRtc-typedefs is ensured.

Implementation: Struct derived from typRTS_SYSTIMEDATE, extended by more information fields. For details see â€˜typWagoTimeComponentsâ€™ in the appendix â€˜Typesâ€™. Range: Year 1 .. year 65535 Resolution: 1 nanosecond Application: Representation of components of time, mainly for printimg purpose. As this struct is extended from typRTS_SYSTIMEDATE , the base variable type may still be used in applications, because assignment to the base variables will not require any conversion: By this means, compatibility to legacy code which still needs the 3S-SysTimeRtc-typedefs is ensured.

Graphical Illustration

Dates behind 2038 and before 1970 will be rejected.

A few dates near the last day of the posix range will also be rejected, although they might be valid. This is done in order to avoid problems with local timezones near the limits of the posix range.

Note: Due to problems with the system date, all dates with year 2038 and beyond are regarded as invalid. More precisely: 17.1.2038 is the last valid date (even if POSIX goes some hours further) because the POSIX range could be exceeded due to Timezone-effects.

| Input | ltActual | LTIME | actual timestamp |
| ltReference | LTIME | reference timestamp |

Retrieves the difference of two â€˜longâ€™ timestamps (actual - reference) in nanoseconds

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

Providing this function is necessary, because standard Codesys differences of LTIMEs would not yield negative values, i.e. no information if one stamp is â€˜beforeâ€™ or â€˜afterâ€™ the other.

Note (1): The result of the difference may be positive or negative, depending on whether the â€˜actualâ€™ stamp is later or earlier than the â€˜referenceâ€™.

Note (2): In contrast to the 32-bit TIME-stamps, LTIME-stamps are considered to be absolute, so no wrap-around of this value will be considered. When the computed difference is larger than the range of the result (i.e. larger than 292 years), the result will be clamped to +-16#7FFF.FFFF.FFFF.FFFF, (which indicates an overflow) in order to avoid undetected overflows.

Use this function for calculating intervals where it is important that any setting of the clock must not have any effect on that calculation.

In contrast to â€˜FuGetLongTime()â€™, the return value of â€˜FuGetLongSystemTime()â€™ is not related to an absolute calendar time, but to the start of the system. Consequently, any setting of the time has no effect on â€˜FuGetLongSystemTime()â€™ (but would have on â€˜FuGetLongTime()â€™).

This is important for implementing strictly monotonic timecounting in device drivers and related applications.

The time format LTIME combines the representation of absolute time (in millisecond resolution) and large value range (584 years). It is uniformly applicable without having to worry about overflow or reference points.

Note: This Funktion returns the absolute time in millisecound resolution. For a resolution in ns use â€˜FuGetLongSystemTime()â€™

## FuGetSystemTime (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type |

| Return | FuGetSystemTime | TIME |

Retrieves the system time.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This function is useful for short term time interval with medium precision. It yields the 32-bit standard system time in milliseconds.

Note(1): This timestamp overflows after 49 days and it does not provide absolute time reference. If any of that is a problem, use FuGetLongTime (FUN) instead.

Note(2): This function is identical to TIME(). It is included here for the sake of completeness and of easier access.

```

Retrieves the difference of two timestamps (actual-reference) in milliseconds

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The result of the difference may be positive or negative, depending upon if the â€˜actualâ€™ stamp is later or earlier than the â€˜referenceâ€™. As it is likely to encounter wrap-arounds of the 32-Bit value throughout the runtime of a system, differences which are larger than ~24 days are regarded as negative differences (â€˜earlierâ€™) while others are regarded as positive differences (â€˜laterâ€™).

Due to the way the 32-bit-wrap-around is handled and the sign-uncertaincy, overflow conditions are not detected in this function.

Note: This function is convenient especially in those case where it is uncertain in which order two stamped events occur, and which would require the usage of other type-casting functions anyway:

Functional description

The method takes a key string for the desired time zone as argument.

In the WAGO approach, timezones are not intended to be constructed or defined at IEC level. Instead, the lower layers of the PLC hold a database which contains well-established time zone descriptions for each part of the earth. The argument â€˜sDataBaseKeyâ€™ is supposed to be a key string to this database.

More details about valid values for time zone identifications are given in section â€˜Configuration of Time and Date - TZ Stringâ€™ of the PFC200 Manual .

A summary of valid time zone keys is given in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

Note (1): The user is not supposed to establish his own time zones from within IEC-context. He may, however, change the database manually and provide new time zones on that way.
