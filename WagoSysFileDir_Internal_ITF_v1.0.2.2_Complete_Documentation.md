Special system entries, such as ‚Äù.‚Äù and ‚Äù..‚Äù are generally skipped.

On success, the method returns 0, on Failure an appropriate error code is returned. When the last entry has been read or the directory is empty, the following Read() returns ENODATA := 61 : No data available

On other faults, the specific fault code is returned.

Opens a file for reading.

corresponds to ‚Äúopen(2)‚Äù

Un success, the FILE-fb transits to the state ‚ÄòxIsOpen‚Äô and further operations (such as write, read, close, flush) may be performed on this instance.

Besides the String, the user has to specify the access mode and the exclusivity mode. If the xExclusive-Flag is set, the file is granted to have - no other write-acces if opened for reading and - no other access at all if opened for writing. If that cannot be granted on opening, then open() fails with EBUSY. When a file is opened exclusively , subsequent opens() from other instances would fail, if that would collide with the previous restrictions.

If an open File-FB will encounter a second Open(), it will be cosed first before the new Open() will be performed.

The directory may contain content, but there must not be open references into that directory. If the new path needs the creation of new subdirectories, these directories will be created.

In addition to regular Linux-Beahaviour, this function may move files also between different media. In this case, a timeout may be applied. When resuming a time-outed inter-media-move, xAllowMerge must be applied.

### Interfaces


## IWagoSysDirInternal (ITF)


This is the interface to a Directory-FB.

Directory FBs are used to scan directories for their included files. They behave as Read-Only-File-Systems.

This is the interface to a Directory-FB. Directory FBs are used to scan directories for their included files. They behave as Read-Only-File-Systems. - For accessing file entries, the Dir-FB must be opened first. - In further steps information about each item in the directory (file or subdirectory) is provided by the Read() method. - Finally, the directory has to be closed again, in order to free the resources for other usage, e.g. for RemoveFile(), etc, which would be blocked if the directory, in which that file resides is still opened by a directory-FB# - IWagoSysDirInternal.Close (METH) - IWagoSysDirInternal.EofReached (PROP) - IWagoSysDirInternal.IsOpen (PROP) - IWagoSysDirInternal.LastResult (PROP) - IWagoSysDirInternal.Open (METH) - IWagoSysDirInternal.Read (METH)

## IWagoSysFileInternal (ITF)


This Interface provides Access to a generic File Object.

Internal Details, such as File-handles etc. will be hidden from the user, who operates on FBs only. Reason: size and internal structure of such handles may vary between different systems.

## IWagoSysFsInternal (ITF)


In this interface, all functions are summarized, which operate on the whole file system.

In most cases they do not have any awareness of sequential operations or internal states / variables, wheareas in others (e.g. ‚ÄúsetWorkingDirectory‚Äù) they very well have.

note: in most cases these functions have their POSIX-pendants with quite similar behaviour.

indicates whether the directory-FB is open for reading.

## IWagoSysDirInternal.LastResult (PROP)


represents the result code of the last method

corresponds to ‚Äúerrno‚Äù

represents the result code of the last method corresponds to ‚Äúerrno‚Äù

## IWagoSysFileInternal.EofReached (PROP)


indicates the end of the file for read access.

if the FB was not open, this property is TRUE;

## IWagoSysFileInternal.IsOpen (PROP)


indicates, if a File-FB is open or not.

indicates, if a File-FB is open or not.

## IWagoSysFileInternal.IsReadable (PROP)


specifies, if the FB allows read-access

specifies, if the FB allows read-access

## IWagoSysFileInternal.IsWritable (PROP)


specifies if write-access is permitted to the File-FB

specifies if write-access is permitted to the File-FB

## IWagoSysFileInternal.LastResult (PROP)


represents the result code of the last method

corresponds to ‚Äúerrno‚Äù

represents the result code of the last method corresponds to ‚Äúerrno‚Äù

## IWagoSysFileInternal.Pos (PROP)


returns the actual position of the file pointer

corresponds to ‚Äúfgetpos(3)‚Äù

if the file is not open or does not allow positioning, the position is -1.

returns the actual position of the file pointer corresponds to ‚Äúfgetpos(3)‚Äù if the file is not open or does not allow positioning, the position is -1.

## IWagoSysFsInternal.LastResult (PROP)


represents the result code of the last method

corresponds to ‚Äúerrno‚Äù

represents the result code of the last method corresponds to ‚Äúerrno‚Äù

## IWagoSysFsInternal.WorkingDirectory (PROP)


retrieves the name of the current working directory if set and an empty string else.

complement to ‚Äúpwd‚Äù

Note: although the workung directory can as well be retrieved and set, the setter-function is designed as method ‚ÄúChangWorkingDirectory (cd)‚Äù, because it could potentially fail. The getter-function instead is designed as property get, because it does not return a status result.

Note: This is a general mapping of result codes to short standard texts which are appropriate to the usage of these codes in this library.

Typially, each unit (function, method, or function block) in this library uses only a subset of these codes. Please, refer to the documentation of the specific unit for the set of codes which is actualy used and for a detailed explanation of the meaning of a result code in the specifc context.
