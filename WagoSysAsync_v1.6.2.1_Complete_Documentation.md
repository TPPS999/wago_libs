Graphical Interface of FbBehaviourModelWagoEnableAsync

Function Description

For use the user has to re-implement the PROTECTED methods protRun() and protTerminate() . The first is the main runner wich is called periodically while xEnable is TRUE. The latter is used for controlled shutdown of the FB when xEnable is turned FALSE again.

This model has three internal states:

While xEnable is TRUE , the Method protRun() is executed asynchronously and repeatedly.

As long as protRun() returns EAGAIN , the FB output xValid is kept FALSE . This output gets TRUE when protRun() returns OK. Other result codes will be interpreted as an error condition and they will be displayed accordingly at the outputs.

The method protRun() will be called regardless whether its previous call returned an error or not.

When xEnable is set FALSE again, the Method protTerminate() is called at least once. The further behaviour depends again on the eResultCode:

The method protTerminate() need not to be implemented if no functionality is connected to it. On default it returns ENOSYS which switches the FB directly from â€˜Runâ€™ to â€˜idleâ€™.

Attention: The derived child FB has to call SUPER^.() in its body.

Function Description

This model has three internal states

The very first cycle in the life of an application. As xAction cannot be reset during initialization due to technical reasons, it is initialized in this first cycle.

This state is indicated by eStatus being set to EDEFAULT . The value of xTrigger is not defined at this moment. The FB transits into Idle from this state within one cycle.

The FB calls protRun() repeatedly until it returns OK or any code other than EAGAIN, then transits to Idle and resets xAction again.

This state is indicated by having eStatus set temporarily to EINPROGRESS and xTrigger not being reset. Upon termination of the action, eStatus will be set either to OK or to the returned error code.

When this model is used, the application is strongly recommended to ensure that xAction is never reset to FALSE from outside of this FB. From outside, xAction should only be set to TRUE, never to FALSE.

When the action returns either EINPROGRESS or EDEFAULT, that code will be re-mapped to EUNSPECIFIC in order to avoid ambiguities if eStatus.

Attention: The derived child FB has to call SUPER^.(xAction:=xAction) in its body.

The Fb_AsyncOneShot_Base is a base class for a one-shot runner which is to be scheduled.

Graphical Illustration

Graphical Interface of Fb_AsyncOneShot_Base

Function Description

This function block provides for simple asynchronous deferring of a non-repetitive job. It behaves according to the WagoTrigger - behaviour model.

The additional parameter eSchedMode controls the scheduling mode and/or priority. The scheduling mode can be given in various alternative ways, e.g.:

For usage, the user is supposed to derive a child object from this base and simply implement the job functionality in the run() method (as this FB is a child of Fb_GenericRunner ). The runner will be deferred automatically according to the behaviour model WagoTrigger and the output variables will be set automatically according to the runnerâ€™s result.

In contrast to the more elaborated and more general Fb_Async_Base , this FB does not provide for automatic synchronous initialization, repetitive asynchronous execution, synchronous nor asynchronous cleanup, or cooperative collection of general results of the job.

Instead, it provided a simplified way for deferring simple jobs.

Of course, mechanisms for initialization, synchronization, etc. could be added in child FBs, but if you go this way, you would end up with Fb_Async_Base again - which already exists. This FB is used mainly for embedding deferred execution into other FBs rather than as base for enduser FBs.

How to Use:

If the runner (i.e. the method â€˜run()â€™) returns a status code, that status code will be displayed as output variable.

The output xBusy stays TRUE until the runner is terminated.

In contrast to the more complex models â€˜Fb_Async_Baseâ€™ or â€˜FbBehaviourModelWagoTriggerAsyncâ€™, this base class merely lets the runner run once but it does not provede means for synchronous initialization or repeated execution. The benefit of that reduction is a very small and easy interface.

Consequence: The result code of the runner does not affect the functional behaviour of this base class.

This base class is not suitable for constructing complex asynchrounous behaviour models. Those would normally require periodical repetition of the runner - which would be a DAEMON-like behaviour and not a ONE-SHOT, as it is the topic of this base class.

No further operations are necessary for child classes. Scheduling and final removal of the terminated job are handled by this base class.

Scheduling Modes:

Like all other asynchronous FBs, this One-Shot base class may operate with all scheduling modes which are listed in eSchedulingModes :

When execution is to be coupled to external events, this is also noted via the Scheduling Mode. But as it depends on the individual target if a specific event is supported or not, a type casting wrapper SchedulingMode() has to be added in order to avouid warnings:

Some targets will now or in future allow for combining external events with addidional priority informations. Those targets provide for an addidtional mode wrapper, which allows for passing both parameters in the same call. The resulting eSchedulingMode may again be used in all asynchronous FBs.

Please note that some target firmware versions might silently ignore the additional priority number if it is not supported by the target.

Caveat: While the execution is not finished and the runner has not produced any result, the result code is not OK but it is EINPROGRESS without having xError set. This is regular behaviour and not an error condition.

This FB is used mainly for embedding deferred execution into other FBs rather than as base for enduser FBs. How to Use: 1. Derive a child class of this base and declare a public method â€˜Run() : eResultCodeâ€™. This method â€˜Run()â€™ will be executed asynchronously once for each individual request. 2. Be sure to include SUPER^(xTrigger:=xTrigger); in the body of the child in order to participate in the parentâ€™s base framework functionality. 3. Declase one or more instances of the child class and use them according to the behaviour model â€˜WagoTriggerâ€™. Details: If the runner (i.e. the method â€˜run()â€™) returns a status code, that status code will be displayed as output variable. The output xBusy stays TRUE until the runner is terminated.

Fb_Async_base is a base FB for asynchronous execution of jobs. It is never instatiated directly but it serves as base class for deriving own FBs.

Graphical Interface of Fb_Async_Base

Function Description

Although this base FB has some uniform status outputs it is completely method driven.

As indicated in the section â€˜Generalâ€™, the user is supposed to derive his own FB from this base FB and implement his own protected methods according to his needs.

The asynchronous job is started with the PROTECTED method _TriggerExecute() of the base interface. Typically, when the user derives his own FB, he will provide his own public Trigger() method for PUBLIC use, which sets up variables and then internally calls the PROTECTED _TriggerExecute() .

General Application Rules

Base FB Outputs

The outputs are cleared with successful calls of the methods _TriggerExecute() or _AcknowledgeTermination() .

The output interface resembles the behaviour model WagoExecute but it is not the same due to the many necesseties of method driven operation.

For using the standard behaviour directly, other asynchronous FBs are derived from the base and provided by this library. Those are less flexible, but they carry the canonical interfaces of WagoEnable (async) , WagoExecute (async) , and WagoTrigger (async) .

Scheduling of protected methods

Depending on the input stimulus of the base interface, the virtual methods protInitialize() , protMainRun() , protDone() , protAbortionCleanup() , and protAsynchronousCleanup() were called from within the framework of the Fb_Async_Base. These methods (or some of them) should be re-implemented in the derived class according to following specifications given in the interface description Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution (FB) . The outputs variables of the base FB are set according to the results of the function calls in derived FBs.

Depending on the scheduling mode, the execution of these methods may be deferred to other asynchronous tasks in order to keep the calling instance non-blocking while waiting for the result during several cycles. This process is hidden from the application by the interface. Thus, the call to the derived FB may return even before the called functionalities have terminated. By observing xTerminated the calling application is notified that the execution in the background is terminated.

The application may signal its wish for abortion of the FBâ€™s process either explicitly by the or _Abort() -Method or implicitly by setting the property tTimeOut (0 = no timeout applies). The process then is aborted as soon as possible in cooperation with the implemented functions (the process is not â€˜killedâ€™).

Result Codes

The base result codes of the eResult output are shown below. These codes are generated by the Fb_Async_Base itself. If the child object returns with its own result codes, these will also appear at this place.

Generally the child may use any result code according to its own specification with the exception of EAGAIN which is reserved for the wish to repeat the execution.

Example 1: Long running function

A simple long-running function myLongRunningFunction() is to be executed asynchronously. For implementing this, an FB is derived from the Fb_Async_Base (which is a child of Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution (FB) ). In this simple case, one single method protMainRun`() is re-implemented, which contains that long running function:

No other code is to be added.

(Please note that the purpose of the this code snippet is merely to illustrate the usage of certain mechanisms and thus is shortened to the essential parts for explanation. It does not compile as-is.)

Example 2: Multiple long running methods

An existing FB originalFB with a number of long-running methods is to be executed asynchronously:

For realization, again a new fb derivedFB is derived from Fb_Async_Base (FB) , in which the original FB is embedded. All long running methods of the original FB are wrapped by trigger methods. These trigger methods do also perform the task of individual initialization:

(Please note that the purpose of the this code snippet is merely to illustrate the usage of certain mechanisms and thus is shortened to the essential parts for explanation. It does not compile as-is.)

Example 3: FB with long running body

If the body of the asynchronous FB is very long-running but has certain points where processing could be interrupted, it may signal this circumstance by returning EAGAIN at such points. The FB will be re-scheduled for asynchronous operation again until it returns OK , or a result code other than EAGAIN . If a request for abortion or time-out has been issued inbetween, it will not be re-scheduled.

(Please note that the purpose of the this code snippet is merely to illustrate the usage of certain mechanisms and thus is shortened to the essential parts for explanation. It does not compile as-is.)

Typically, when the user derives his own FB, he will provide his own public Trigger() method for PUBLIC use, which sets up variables and then internally calls the PROTECTED _TriggerExecute() . General Application Rules 1. The body of the derived FB MUST contain super^(); for using the execution logic. 2. Unless especially noted, most methods of this FB are intended to be either PRIVATE or PROTECTED. I.e. they should never be called directly from outside of the class, even if not all of them are actually declared PRIVATE or PROTECTED for technical reasons. Either the child FB inherits these methods for direct protected usage or the child FB re-implements some (or all) of them. Thus, no component of the PROTECTED Interface ) appears in the public interface of the child by default. The child is supposed to use its own wrapper methods or interface variables for making the desired subset of them accessible to the application. Base FB Outputs xTerminated: This output indicates that the execution is terminated, successfully or with errors. This output is cleared with successful calls of the methods _TriggerExecute() or _AcknowledgeTermination() . xBusy: Indicates that _TriggerExecute() has been executed successfully and that the job has not yet terminated. It is cleared after termination of the job. While set to TRUE this output indicates that other output variables may vary spontaneously. While set to FALSE, outputs do not vary spontaneously. xError: Indicates the presence of an error. Attn: This output may be TRUE simultaneously with other outputs. eResult: This indicates the actual state of processing or errors. While the job is not terminated, it displays EINPROGRESS which is not an error condition but just tells that the process is still in progress. The outputs are cleared with successful calls of the methods _TriggerExecute() or _AcknowledgeTermination() . Note The output interface resembles the behaviour model WagoExecute but it is not the same due to the many necesseties of method driven operation.

Fb_Daemon_Base is a base class for asynchronous DAEMON-FBs.

Graphical Illustration

Graphical Interface of Fb_Daemon_Base

Function Description

In the context of this library a â€˜daemonâ€™ is a functionality which runs repetitively or continuously in the background and which has only loose interactions with other applications.

This FB is a base class for such a daemon according to the base model WagoChannel . Like for GenericRunner or OneShot , the functionality is provided by the method run() , while this base FB provides for the framework of starting with a certain scheduling mode or priority and of stopping the daemon again.

For usage, the user is supposed to derive a child object from this base and implement the functionality in the run() method

When the input xOpen transits from FALSE to TRUE , the daemon is scheduled according to the mode given by the input eSchedMode at that moment. E.g. as follows:

The output xIsOpen indicates successful scheduling. When the runner method terminates, it will be automatically re-scheduled internally for a new execution. By this means, a daemon provides for a non-terminating execution of the runner.

When the input xOpen transits to FALSE again, the deamon is stopped. This condition is indicated by the output xIsOpen in FALSE state. At this point in time, the asynchronously executed daemon might still be running. The daemon is not simply killed, but when it terminates, it will not be re-scheduled and the removed after this last termination. The output xIsIdle will not go TRUE before the daemon is successfully removed.

While xIsIdle is not TRUE, the daemon cannot be re-started, because the old daemon resources has to be successfully cleaned-up first.

The output eStatus refers to starting and stopping the daemon, but it does not not (as explained below) refer to any internal error conditions of the daemon.

A TRUE level at the xOpen -input causses the method run() of the daemon to be scheduled repeatedly, and a FALSE causes it to stop again.

Although the runner method has a eResultCode return value for formal reasons, this value is ignored during execution, because it is not likely to yield useful information within a daemon context. The eStatus output does only reflect the success of starting or stopping the daemon, but it does not reflect the internal status of the daemon runner itself. If the daemon has to communicate internal information to the application, it has to define its own outputs for that purpose.

The result code of the daemon runner is accessible to the FB only after the runner has terminated, so for continuously running background daemons there must be provided other ways of communicating errors.

This base class provides for a property DaemonCycleCount:UDINT which counts the number of consecutive runs of the runner, starting with â€˜1â€™ for the first execution. This is useful for asynchronous initialization of the daeomon, which should take place only during the first run of the daemon.

There is no formal limitation for the runtime of a single run of a daemon. Nevertheless the user should be aware that excessive long running might block other daemons or other processes.

The output eStatus refers to starting and stopping the daemon, but it does not not (as explained below) refer to any internal error conditions of the daemon. How To Use 1. Derive a child class of this base and declare a public method â€˜Run()â€™. This method â€˜Run()â€™ will be executed repeatedly and asynchronously. 2. Be sure to include SUPER^(); in the body of the child in order to participate in the parentâ€™s base functionality of opening and closing the activity. 3. Declase one or more instances of the child class and use them according to the behaviour model WagoChannel . Details: A TRUE level at the xOpen -input causses the method run() of the daemon to be scheduled repeatedly, and a FALSE causes it to stop again.

Function Description

In contrast to the behaviour model classes, this FB is not meant in the first place to serve as a base for inheritance, but this one is intended to be used directly.

Its main public method â€˜TriggerExecute()â€™ takes a pointer to a generic runner FB as input. This runner can virtually be treated as a function pointer together with member variables. Its method â€˜run()â€™ will be executed asynchronously.

In contrast to the behaviour models, this runner is executed only once per trigger.

Graphical Interface of Fb_Async_Base._Abort

Function Description

This method sets the flag for cooperative abortion, which will be evaluated by the runner process. When the runner detects this flag, it may cooperatively abort prematurely if this behaviour is implemented in the runner code.

If the runner has returned EAGAIN (and has possibly has ignored the abortion signal), it will NOT be restarted after this method is called and the framework will show the result code ECANCELED.

This method does not unconditionally abort the runner. It merely sets flags which the runner may regard or disregard.

Function Description

After termination of the main runner this method sets the basic output variables back to their idle values and then transits the FB back into the idle state.

This is convenient, when a derived FB uses a variable oriented interface:

This method mainly resets the output variables xTerminated and xError. In a purely method orientated child it is not necessary to use this function unless these variables are used elsewhere within the FB.

Function Description

This method provides synchronous post-processing after termination of the main task.

This method allows for easy passing of output results from inner FB layers (e.g. the FILE object in an asynchronous File-FB or other local variables) to the output variables of the specialized FB. When using this, protMainRun() has to deal only with internal variables and is completely decoupled from the public interface.

This method accepts as input the result code of the terminated process in order to allow for appropriate reactions to error conditions, if needed.

It does not provide a result code itself, because it is not supposed to contain failable code.

Code for initialization in derived FBs.

Graphical Illustration

Graphical Interface of Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution.protInitialize

Function Description

This method will be called synchronously, i.e. directly after triggering the derived FB.

This method is called from the base FB immediately (always synchronously) with the call of _TriggerExecute(), before the main run starts. It is intended to provide the initialization of the variables (esp. buffering of input variables) of the derived FB immediately after starting, while the (probably long-running) main process might be postponed asynchronously.

When protInitialize() returns a result code other than OK (=0), further asynchronous processing does not take place und the result code is displayed at the eResult output with xError being set. A typical error code would be EINVAL (â€˜Invalid argumentâ€™) - although the user is free to use his own error code. Pleae note that code EAGAIN is also valid in principle, but should be avoided so as not to cause confusion: Other methods use EAGAIN for indicating the necessity of further processing.

When protInitialize() finds that all necessary actions of the whole functionality can take place synchronously within the protInitialize()-method and no asynchronous running is necessary, it may return the code EALREADY. This will cause the base FB to directly terminate successfully and to omit protPrimaryRun().

Code for repeated asynchronous execution.

Graphical Illustration

Graphical Interface of Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution.protMainRun

Function Description

This method is executed asynchronously with native breakpoints at the end of each cycle.

This method is called asynchronously following the synchronous call of protInitialize(). In contrast to the latter, ProtMainRun() is not guaranteed to start immediately, but in might be scheduled for future execution, depending on the scheduling mode. Typically, this method carries out the main (long-running) functionality of the derived FB.

Via the property â€˜CycleCountâ€™, protMainRun() is able to detect whether it is called initially or subsequently.

Due to the potentially deferred execution, the input variables of the derived FB should not be processed directly within this method, because of the rather poorly defined timing. Instead they should be buffered from protInitialize() or from the derived trigger call.

The output â€˜xBusyâ€™ will be set synchronously with the _TriggerExecute() but this does not indicate that protMainRun() has yet started.

The protMainRun() is supposed to return OK (=0) on successful termination. Upon detecting this, the framework will set xTerminated accordingly. When further processing is necessary after the initial run, this is signalled by the result code EAGAIN. Other non-zero result code will also terminate the execution and set the eResult output to the returned result code.

When very simple functionalities are implemented by the child FB, this method might be the only one to be invoked.

Graphical Illustration

Graphical Interface of Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution.AbortRequest

Function Description

This property signals to the derived methods that the IEC has task requested the abortion of the asynchronous execution.

In the derived FB, this property may be read in order to perform a cooperative premature termination of the job:

This abort request may be caused either by a timeout, by an external abort signal or for some other reason. The derived protMainRun() may or may not honor this flag, depending on what the user has implemented.

When this flag is not honored by protMainRun() but protManRun() returns EAGAIN, this flag causes the framework of Fb_Async_Base to not continue with further execution but to proceed with cleanup instead.

This library WagoSysAsync provides the possibility to transfer long running functions or FBs into a separate context and let them execute asynchronously while the calling application task is still responsive during the execution.

The fundamental usage of this mechanism consists in wrapping the desired functionality into standardized base FBs, which resemble very closely the regular behaviour models . In the application, new FBs were derived from that base FB and the required interface functions were overloaded.

Usage of this library

The intended usage of this library is to derive own FBs from the base FBs which are provided here. For simple cases the user finds specialized base FBs, such as Fb_Daemon_Base (FB) or Fb_AsyncOneShot_Base (FB) as well as base FBs for behaviour models, such as (e.g.) FbBehaviourModelWagoExecuteAsync (FB) as asynchronous model for WagoExecute .

For more complex cases, Fb_Async_Base (FB) provides for more complexity. If in this case, the user derives his FB from Fb_Async_Base , he derives indirectly from the protected interface Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution (FB) (which is declared as FB instead of as Itf for technical reasons). This interface contains all protected methods, which may be overloaded by the user if they ware used.

Only those methods which contain real functionality need to be implemented by the child object. Unlike in â€˜technicalâ€™ interfaces, methods which are not needed may simply be omitted.

Please note further, that you do not derive from Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution (FB) directly, but from Fb_Async_Base (FB) , which is a grandchild of the latter. The role of Fb_Async_Base consists only in providing the framework for synchromnous and asynchronous scheduling - which is completely separated from the user code.

When own FBs are derived from Fb_Async_Base it is typically necessary to add own interface variables and to implement own functionality. The first should be done in the interface blcok of the derived FB itself, while the latter should be done by overloading the Fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution (FB) -methods and introducing own PRIVATE methods if necessary. In no case, the user is supposed to touch anything else from Fb_Async_Base and for this reason anything else in Fb_Async_Base is declared private or final.

The fb_VirtualMethodsForAsyncExecution -methods are declared PROTECTED, i.e. they are supposed to be eventually overloaded by child FBs, but they must not be called directly from the application or anything else outside the FB-declaration.

Standard Behaviour Models

For the sake of convenience other FBs beyond the fundamental â€˜Fb_Async_Baseâ€™ are provided, which resemble the standard behaviour models from â€˜WagoSysBehaviourmodels.libraryâ€™. Like their sysnchronous brothers, the asynchronous models have a variable-oriented interface and a set of protected methods which represent the functionality. Additionally they have properties like scheduling mode and timeout , which do not apply for their synchronous counterparts.

Scheduling Modes and Priorities

The library WagoTypesCommon defines a set of priorities and scheduling modes which are represented by the enumeration type eSchedulingMode , e.g. :

Additionally, the scheduling may be connected to some specific external events by using a wrapping function :

Some target hardware allows for combining external events with additional scheduling priority. In this case, the wrapping function SchedulingMode_EventPriority() is to be used for combining both to a single scheduling mode value:
