| Scope | Name | Type | Inherited from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Output | oError | WagoSysErrorBase.FbResult | FbModuleBase |

Interface variables - FbModule_75x_644.protCheckPaSIze (METH)

### Methods


## FbModule_75x_644.protCheckPaSIze (METH)


| Scope | Name | Type | Initial | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | protCheckPaSIze | BOOL |  |  |
| Input | uiPaNominalBitSize | UINT |  | The expected bit size of the module |
| ITerminal | WagoTypesBusServices.I_TerminalBase | 0 | Interface to terminal at that this module is registered |

This method is called at static configuration for Kbus-Modules only. If this method returns with TRUE a reboot of the controller will be initiated.

At the derivated method you have to manipulate the registers of the module to change for the wanted uiPaNominalBitSize .

The wanted uiPaNominalBitSize is calculated by the devcie description.

You have not to return before the needed register change was done by your implementation.
