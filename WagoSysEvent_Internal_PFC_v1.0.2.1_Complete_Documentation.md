Standard result items specific for this library

Note: This is a general mapping of result codes to short standard texts which are appropriate to the usage of these codes in this library.

Typially, each unit (function, method, or function block) in this library uses only a subset of these codes. Please, refer to the documentation of the specific unit for the set of codes which is actualy used and for a detailed explanation of the meaning of a result code in the specifc context.
