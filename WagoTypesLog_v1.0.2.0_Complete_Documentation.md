### Interfaces


## I_LogChannel (ITF)


This interface represents a log channel. A log channel can registered for listening to all Log-Messages at a FbLogger . After registration all Log-Messages from the Logger will be send to this channel. The channel have to put the message to the wanted destination. For registration the FbLogger offers the method FbLogger.RegisterLogChannel . It is possible to register one channel to many loggers for getting all messages from these loggers.

Also it is possibele to register a channel via the LoggerManager at many loggers.
