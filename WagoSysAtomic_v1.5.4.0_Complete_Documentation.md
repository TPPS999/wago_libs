This library provides an interface for atomic variable access.

For multiple data types a number of atomic access methods (description: see below) is provided: Not all methods apply to all types: While e.g. Read() applies to all data types, e.g. bitmanipulations are not provided for pointer types.

The operations are the following:

Core Operations

Atomic Integer Arithmetic

Atomic Bitfield Operations

This library provides an interface for atomic variable access. For multiple data types a number of atomic access methods (description: see below) is provided: Not all methods apply to all types: While e.g. Read() applies to all data types, e.g. bitmanipulations are not provided for pointer types. Caveats: - 8-Bit-Datatypes and 16-Bit-Datatypes are not covered by this library (specification[4]) - Datatype ‚ÄúPointer‚Äù has a variable size, depending on the target native datasize (mostly 32-Bit, in future 64-Bit also) - Variables must be aligned to 4-Byte-boundaries or 8-Byte-boundaries. Normally, the Codesys-compiler automatically takes care to place these variables accordingly. The operations are the following: Core Operations CompareAndSet(&Variable, probeValue, newValue) : BOOL ( CAS ): Compares A variable against a probe and sets the variable to the new value if both are equal. Returns TRUE if both are equial, FALSE otherwise Swap(&variable, newValue) : oldvalue : Sets the variable to a new value and returns the old value Read(&Variable) : oldvalue : Delivers the value of a variable. TestAndDec(&variable) : oldvalue ( TAD ): Decreases a variable by one if it is greater than zero. The previous value is returned. If the variable was zero, it will not be modified. Atomic Integer Arithmetic Add/Sub(&Variable, summand) : result : Adds/Subtracts a value to/from a variable Inc/Dec(&Variable) : result : Increases/Decreases a variable atomically by one Atomic Bitfield Operations TestAndSet(&Variable, bitno) : BOOL ( TAS ): Sets a bit in a 32-Bit-Field and returns its previous value. The bitnumber counts from 0 (least significant Bit in Little-Endian-Representation) to 31. Other bitnumbers will be silently discarded. TestAndReset(&Variable, bitno) : BOOL ( TAR ): Resets a bit in a 32-Bit-Field and returns its previous value. The bitnumber counts from 0 (least significant Bit in Little-Endian-Representation) to 31. Other bitnumbers will be silently discarded. And/Or/Xor(&Variable, operand): newvalue : Logical operations to a variable.

Standard result items specific for this library

Note: This is a general mapping of result codes to short standard texts which are appropriate to the usage of these codes in this library.

Typially, each unit (function, method, or function block) in this library uses only a subset of these codes. Please, refer to the documentation of the specific unit for the set of codes which is actualy used and for a detailed explanation of the meaning of a result code in the specifc context.
