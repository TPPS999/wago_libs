FuSock_Accept() accepts a new connection on a socket.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Accept() function will extract the first connection on the queue of pending connections, create a new socket with the same socket type protocol and address family as the specified socket, return the new socket handle for that socket.

The FuSock_Accept() function takes the following arguments:

If pAddress is not a null pointer, the address of the peer for the accepted connection is stored in the sockaddr structure pointed to by address, and the length of this address is stored in the object pointed to by pAddress_len .

If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored address is truncated.

If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer is not bound, then the value stored in the object pointed to by address is unspecified.

If the listen queue is empty of connection requests and O_NONBLOCK is not set on the file descriptor for the socket, FuSock_Accept() will block until a connection is present. If the FuSock_Listen() queue is empty of connection requests and O_NONBLOCK is set on the socket handle for the socket, FuSock_Accept() will fail and return EWOULDBLOCK .

The accepted socket cannot itself accept more connections. The original socket remains open and can accept more connections.

If this function fails, it will return an invalid handle where all bits are set to 1 and indicate the error cause via the output eResult . In case of success this output shows 0=OK

The FuSock_Accept() function will fail if:

The FuSock_Accept() function may fail if:

The FuSock_Accept() function takes the following arguments: - Socket : Specifies a socket that was created with FuSock_Socket (FUN) , has been bound to an address with FuSock_Bind (FUN) , and has issued a successful call to FuSock_Listen (FUN) . - pAddress : Either a null pointer, or a pointer to a sockaddr structure where the address of the connecting socket will be returned. - pAddress_len : Either a null pointer, if address is a null pointer, or a pointer to a UDINT object which on input specifies the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, and on output specifies the length of the stored address. If pAddress is not a null pointer, the address of the peer for the accepted connection is stored in the sockaddr structure pointed to by address, and the length of this address is stored in the object pointed to by pAddress_len . If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored address is truncated.

The accepted socket cannot itself accept more connections. The original socket remains open and can accept more connections. ERRORS: If this function fails, it will return an invalid handle where all bits are set to 1 and indicate the error cause via the output eResult . In case of success this output shows 0=OK The FuSock_Accept() function will fail if: - ENOTSOCK (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The Socket argument is was either not generated by this library, or was deallocated already or does not qualify to be a socket by other reasons. - EWOULDBLOCK (mandatory for POSIX compliance): O_NONBLOCK is set for the socket socket handle and no connections are present to be accepted. - EINVAL (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The socket is not accepting connections. - EUNSPECIFIC: A general problem with this function is encountered and no further details about the reason are available. (none known so far) - ENOSUCCESS: An unexpected problem with this function is encountered with a differenciated reason that does not does not fit into the POSIX scheme. The FuSock_Accept() function may fail if: - ENOMEM (mandatory for POSIX compliance): There was insufficient memory available to complete the operation. - ENOBUFS (mandatory for POSIX compliance): No buffer space is available. The FuSock_Accept() function may also fail in future releases if: - EBADF (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The socket argument is not a valid socket handle. - ECONNABORTED (mandatory for POSIX compliance): A connection has been aborted. - EMFILE (mandatory for POSIX compliance): All socket handles available to the process are currently open. - ENFILE (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The maximum number of socket handles in the system are already open. - EOPNOTSUPP (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The socket type of the specified socket does not support accepting connections. - EPROTO (optional): A protocol error has occurred; for example, the STREAMS protocol stack has not been initialized. Deviation from POSIX.1-2008: - The error code is uniformly provided via the additional output variable eResult:eResultCode , which contains the values specified by POSIX. The POSIX constructs errno or getlasterror() are not supported. - ECONNABORTED is not supported by Codesys. - In certain conditions the system might not be able to deliver differentiated result codes as requested by the POSIX standard. In those cases, where the exact cause cannot be differentiated from other causes, the result codes EUNSPECIFIC and ENOSUCCESS are is returned instead. These codes are not contained in the original POSIX specification. EUNSPECIFIC is used in cases where the system notifies that it cannot differentiate the cause at all ( ERR_FAILED ), while ENOSUCCESS is used when the result code from the system is somewhat differentiated, but cannot be mapped unambiguously to the POSIX requirements.

FuSock_Bind() binds a name to a socket.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Bind() function will assign a local socket address to a socket identified by descriptor socket that has no local socket address assigned. Sockets created with the FuSock_Socket() function are initially unnamed; they are identified only by their address family.

The FuSock_Bind() function takes the following arguments:

If the socket address cannot be assigned immediately and O_NONBLOCK is set for the socket handle for the socket, FuSock_Bind() will fail and return EINPROGRESS , but the assignment request will not be aborted, and the assignment will be completed asynchronously. Subsequent calls to FuSock_Bind() for the same socket, before the assignment is completed, will fail and return EALREADY .

When the assignment has been performed asynchronously, FuSock_Select() will indicate that the socket handle for the socket is ready for reading and writing.

In case of success this function returns 0 (FALSE) and the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure, the return value is TRUE and the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below.

The FuSock_Bind() function fails if:

The following error causes are known to be represented as EUNSPECIFIC due to system firmware:

Function Description

The FuSock_Close() function will deallocate the handle indicated by Socket . To deallocate means to make the handle available for return by subsequent calls to open() or other functions that allocate file descriptors.

In case of success this function returns 0 (FALSE) and the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure, the return value is TRUE and the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below.

The FuSock_Close() function fails if:

While most of the functions of this library return ENOTSOCK if the Socket argument turns out not to be associated to a properly qualified socket, the functions FuSock_Close() and FuSock_Fcntl() return EBADF in that case in order to be compliant to POSIX.1-2008.

FuSock_Connect() connects a socket.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Connect() function will attempt to make a connection on a connection-mode socket or to set or reset the peer address of a connectionless-mode socket. The function takes the following arguments:

If the socket has not already been bound to a local address, FuSock_Connect() will bind it to an address which is an unused local address.

If the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then FuSock_Connect() will set the socketâ€™s peer address, and no connection is made. For SOCK_DGRAM sockets, the peer address identifies where all datagrams are sent on subsequent FuSock_Send() functions, and limits the remote sender for subsequent FuSock_Recv() functions. If the sa_family member of address is AF_UNSPEC , the socketâ€™s peer address will be reset. Note that despite no connection being made, the term â€˜connectedâ€™ is used to describe a connectionless-mode socket for which a peer address has been set.

If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then FuSock_Connect() will attempt to establish a connection to the address specified by the address argument. If the connection cannot be established immediately and O_NONBLOCK is not set for the socket handle for the socket, FuSock_Connect() will block for up to an unspecified timeout interval until the connection is established.

If the timeout interval expires before the connection is established, FuSock_Connect() will fail and the connection attempt will be aborted.

If the connection cannot be established immediately and O_NONBLOCK is set for the socket handle for the socket, FuSock_Connect() will fail and return EINPROGRESS , but the connection request will not be aborted, and the connection will be established asynchronously. Subsequent calls to FuSock_Connect() for the same socket, before the connection is established, will fail and return EALREADY .

When the connection has been established asynchronously, FuSock_Select() will indicate that the socket is ready for writing.

In case of success this function returns 0 (FALSE) and the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure, the return value is TRUE and the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below.

FuSock_Getsockopt() gets get the socket options.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Getsockopt() function retrieves the value for the option specified by the eOption_name argument for the socket specified by the socket argument. If the size of the option value is greater than option_len , the value stored in the object pointed to by the option_value argument is silently truncated. Otherwise, the object pointed to by the pOption_len argument is modified to indicate the actual length of the value.

The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option resides. To retrieve options at the socket level, specify the level argument as SOL_SOCKET. To retrieve options at other levels, supply the appropriate level identifier for the protocol controlling the option. For example, to indicate that an option is interpreted by the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP.

The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the getsockopt() function.

The option_name argument specifies a single option to be retrieved. It can be one of the socket-level options defined in <sys/socket.h> and described in Use of Options.

In case of success this function returns 0 (FALSE) and the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure, the return value is TRUE and the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below.

FuSock_Listen() listens for socket connections and limit the queue of incoming connections.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Listen() function marks a connection-mode socket, specified by the Socket argument, as accepting connections.

The udiBacklog argument provides a hint to the implementation which the implementation uses to limit the number of outstanding connections in the socketâ€™s listen queue. Implementations may impose a limit on backlog and silently reduce the specified value. Normally, a larger backlog argument value should result in a larger or equal length of the listen queue.

The implementation may include incomplete connections in its listen queue. The limits on the number of incomplete connections and completed connections queued may be different.

The implementation may have an upper limit on the length of the listen queue-either global or per accepting socket. If backlog exceeds this limit, the length of the listen queue is set to the limit.

If FuSock_Listen() is called with a backlog argument value that is less than 0, the function behaves as if it had been called with a backlog argument value of 0.

A backlog argument of 0 may allow the socket to accept connections, in which case the length of the listen queue may be set to an implementation-defined minimum value.

In case of success this function returns 0 (FALSE) and the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure, the return value is TRUE and the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below.

FuSock_Recv() receives a message from a connected socket.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Recv() function will receive a message from a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. It is normally used with connected sockets because it does not permit the application to retrieve the source address of received data.

The FuSock_Recv() function takes the following arguments:

Valid flags:

The recv() function will return the length of the message written to the buffer pointed to by the buffer argument. For message-based sockets, such as SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message will be read in a single operation. If a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the flags argument, the excess bytes will be discarded. For stream-based sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM, message boundaries will be ignored. In this case, data will be returned to the user as soon as it becomes available, and no data will be discarded.

If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data will be returned only up to the end of the first message.

If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not set on the socketâ€™s socket handle, recv() will block until a message arrives. If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is set on the socketâ€™s file descriptor, FuSock_Recv() will fail with EWOULDBLOCK.

Upon successful completion, FuSock_Recv() returns the length of the message in bytes. If no messages are available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown, FuSock_Recv() will return 0.

In case of success the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure, the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below and the returned value has set all bits to 1 .

Function Description

The FuSock_Recvfrom() function receives a message from a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. It is normally used with connectionless-mode sockets because it permits the application to retrieve the source address of received data.

The FuSock_Recvfrom() function takes the following arguments:

The FuSock_Recvfrom() function returns the length of the message written to the buffer pointed to by the buffer argument. For message-based sockets, such as SOCK_RAW, SOCK_DGRAM, and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message will be read in a single operation. If a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the flags argument, the excess bytes are be discarded. For stream-based sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM, message boundaries are ignored. In this case, data is returned to the user as soon as it becomes available, and no data is discarded.

Not all protocols provide the source address for messages. If the address argument is not a null pointer and the protocol provides the source address of messages, the source address of the received message is stored in the sockaddr structure pointed to by the address argument, and the length of this address is stored in the object pointed to by the address_len argument.

If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored address is truncated.

If the address argument is not a null pointer and the protocol does not provide the source address of messages, the value stored in the object pointed to by address is unspecified.

If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not set on the socketâ€™s file descriptor, FuSock_Recvfrom() will block until a message arrives. If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is set on the socketâ€™s file descriptor, FuSock_Recvfrom() will fail and return EWOULDBLOCK.

Upon successful completion, FuSock_Recvfrom() returns the length of the message in bytes. If no messages are available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown, FuSock_Recvfrom() returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns an eResult other than â€˜0=OKâ€™ and sets all bits in the return value to â€˜1â€™.

In case of success the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below and the returned value has set all bits to 1 .

Function Description

The FuSock_Select() function examines the file descriptor sets whose addresses are passed in the readfds , writefds , and errorfds parameters to see whether some of their descriptors are ready for reading, are ready for writing, or have an exceptional condition pending, respectively.

The udiNfds argument specifies the range of descriptors to be tested. As its behaviour in connection with actual firmware is not well-defined, this argument is silently ignored. Always all mempers of the fs-sets are tested.

If the readfds argument is not a null pointer, it points to an object of type fd_set that on input specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to read, and on output indicates which file descriptors are ready to read.

If the writefds argument is not a null pointer, it points to an object of type fd_set that on input specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to write, and on output indicates which file descriptors are ready to write.

If the errorfds argument is not a null pointer, it points to an object of type fd_set that on input specifies the file descriptors to be checked for error conditions pending, and on output indicates which file descriptors have error conditions pending.

File descriptor sets of type fd_set can be initialized and tested with FuSock_FD_CLR() , FuSock_FD_ISSET() , FuSock_FD_SET() , and FuSock_FD_ZERO() .

Upon successful completion, the select() function modifies the objects pointed to by the readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments to indicate which file descriptors are ready for reading, ready for writing, or have an error condition pending, respectively, and returns the total number of ready descriptors in all the output sets. For each file descriptor, the corresponding bit is set upon successful completion if it was set on input and the associated condition is true for that file descriptor.

If none of the selected descriptors are ready for the requested operation, the select() function blocks until at least one of the requested operations becomes ready, until the timeout occurs, or until interrupted by a signal. The timeout parameter controls how long the select() function takes before timing out.

On failure, the objects pointed to by the readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments will not be modified. Then the output eResultCode is set to a value other than â€˜0=OKâ€™ and all bits in the return value are set to 1 .

If the timeout interval expires without the specified condition being true for any of the specified file descriptors, the objects pointed to by the readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments have all bits set to 0.

If the timeout parameter is not a null pointer, it specifies a maximum interval to wait for the selection to complete. If the specified time interval expires without any requested operation becoming ready, the function will return.

If the timeout parameter is a null pointer, then the call to select() blocks indefinitely until at least one descriptor meets the specified criteria.

To effect a poll, the timeout parameter should not be a null pointer, and should point to a zero-valued timespec structure.

The use of a timeout does not affect any pending timers set up by alarm() or setitimer().

If the timeout argument specifies a timeout interval greater than the implementation-defined maximum value, the maximum value is used as the actual timeout value. Implementations may also place limitations on the granularity of timeout intervals. If the requested timeout interval requires a finer granularity than the implementation supports, the actual timeout interval will is rounded up to the next supported value.

Exceptional conditions:

If a socket has a pending error, it will be considered to have an exceptional condition pending. Otherwise, what constitutes an exceptional condition is file type-specific. For a file descriptor for use with a socket, it is protocol-specific except as noted below. For other file types it is implementation-defined. If the operation is meaningless for a particular file type, select() indicates that the descriptor is ready for read or write operations, and will indicate that the descriptor has no exceptional condition pending.

If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied input function is the recvmsg() function with parameters requesting normal and ancillary data, such that the presence of either type causes the socket to be marked as readable. The presence of out-of-band data is checked if the socket option SO_OOBINLINE has been enabled, as out-of-band data is enqueued with normal data. If the socket is currently listening, then it is marked as readable if an incoming connection request has been received, and a call to the accept() function completes without blocking.

If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied output function is the sendmsg() function supplying an amount of normal data equal to the current value of the SO_SNDLOWAT option for the socket. If a non-blocking call to the connect() function has been made for a socket, and the connection attempt has either succeeded or failed leaving a pending error, the socket is marked as writable.

A socket is considered to have an exceptional condition pending if a receive operation with O_NONBLOCK clear for the open file description and with the MSG_OOB flag set would return out-of-band data without blocking. (It is protocol-specific whether the MSG_OOB flag would be used to read out-of-band data.) A socket will also be considered to have an exceptional condition pending if an out-of-band data mark is present in the receive queue. Other circumstances under which a socket may be considered to have an exceptional condition pending are protocol-specific and implementation-defined.

Miscellaneous:

If the readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments are all null pointers and the timeout argument is not a null pointer, the select() function blocks for the time specified, or until interrupted by a signal. If the readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments are all null pointers and the timeout argument is a null pointer, the select() function blocks until interrupted by a signal.

In case of success the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below and the returned value has set all bits to 1 .

FuSock_Send() sends a message on a socket.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Send() function initiates the transmission of a message from the specified socket to its peer. The FuSock_Send() function will send a message only when the socket is connected. If the socket is a connectionless-mode socket, the message will be sent to the pre-specified peer address.

The FuSock_Send() function takes the following arguments:

The length of the message to be sent is specified by the length argument. If the message is too long to pass through the underlying protocol, send() will fail and no data will be transmitted.

Successful completion of a call to send() does not guarantee delivery of the message. A return value other than 0=OK indicates only locally-detected errors.

If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted, and the socket socket handle does not have O_NONBLOCK set, FuSock_Send() will block until space is available.

If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted, and the socket socket handle does have O_NONBLOCK set, send() will fail. The FuSock_Select() functions can be used to determine when it is possible to send more data.

Upon successful completion, FuSock_Send() returns the number of bytes sent. Otherwise it sets all bits in the return value to 1 and sets the output eResult accordingly.

In case of success the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below and the returned value has set all bits to 1 .

FuSock_Sendto() sends a message on a socket.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Sendto() function will send a message through a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket.

If the socket is a connectionless-mode socket, the message will be sent to the address specified by pDest_addr if no pre-specified peer address has been set. If a peer address has been pre-specified, either the message will be sent to the address specified by pDest_addr (overriding the pre-specified peer address), or the function returns EISCONN.

If the socket is connection-mode, dest_addr will be ignored.

The FuSock_Sendto() function takes the following arguments:

If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the specified address is a broadcast address for the socket protocol, FuSock_Sendto() will fail if the SO_BROADCAST option is not set for the socket.

The pDest_addr argument specifies the address of the target. The length argument specifies the length of the message.

Successful completion of a call to FuSock_Sendto() does not guarantee delivery of the message. A return value other than 0=OK indicates only locally-detected errors.

If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor does not have O_NONBLOCK set, sendto() will block until space is available. If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set, sendto() will fail.

Upon successful completion, FuSock_Sendto() returns the number of bytes sent via the output udiNBytesSent . Otherwise, a result code other than â€˜0=OKâ€™ is returned and all bits in udiNBytesSent are set to â€˜1â€™.

In case of success the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below and the returned value has set all bits to 1 .

FuSock_Setsockopt() set the socket options.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

The FuSock_Setsockopt() function will set the option specified by the option_name argument, at the protocol level specified by the level argument, to the value pointed to by the option_value argument for the socket associated with the socket handle specified by the Socket argument.

The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option resides. To set options at the socket level, specify the level argument as SOL_SOCKET . To set options at other levels, supply the appropriate level identifier for the protocol controlling the option. For example, to indicate that an option is interpreted by the TCP (Transport Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP .

The eOption_name argument specifies a single option to set. It can be one of the socket-level options and described in Use of Options. If option_name is equal to SO_RCVTIMEO or SO_SNDTIMEO and the implementation supports setting the option, it is unspecified whether the struct timeval pointed to by option_value is stored as provided by this function or is rounded up to align with the resolution of the clock being used.

If FuSock_Setsockopt() is called with option_name equal to SO_ACCEPTCONN , SO_ERROR , or SO_TYPE , the behavior is unspecified.

In case of success this function returns 0 (FALSE) and the output eResult shows 0=OK . In case of failure, the return value is TRUE and the output eResult indicates the error cause as described below.

Note When FB_Exit()ing an FB which uses FuSock_Socket(), the FB must call FuSock_Close (FUN) on FB_Exit in order to de-allocate the system resources. It takes the following arguments: - eDomain : The domain argument specifies the address family used in the communications domain. The address families supported by the system are implementation-defined. - eTtype : The type argument specifies the socket type , which determines the semantics of communication over the socket. - eProtocol : Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket. Specifying a protocol of 0 causes FuSock_Socket() to use an unspecified default protocol appropriate for the requested socket type. If the protocol argument is non-zero, it will specify a protocol that is supported by the address family. If the protocol argument is zero, the default protocol for this address family and type will be used. The protocols supported by the system are implementation-defined. Types: The following socket types are defined; implementations may specify additional socket types: - SOCK_STREAM : Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode byte streams, and may provide a transmission mechanism for out-of-band data. - SOCK_DGRAM : Provides datagrams, which are connectionless-mode, unreliable messages of fixed maximum length. - SOCK_SEQPACKET : Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode transmission paths for records. A record can be sent using one or more output operations and received using one or more input operations, but a single operation never transfers part of more than one record. ERRORS: If this function fails, it will return an invalid handle where all bits are set to 1 and indicate the error cause via the output eResult .

The following error causes are known to be represented as EUNSPECIFIC due to system firmware: - EAFNOSUPPORT (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The implementation does not support the specified address family. - EPROTONOSUPPORT (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The protocol is not supported by the address family, or the protocol is not supported by the implementation. - EPROTOTYPE (mandatory for POSIX compliance): The socket type is not supported by the protocol. - EMFILE (mandatory for POSIX compliance): All socket handles available to the process are currently open. - ENFILE (mandatory for POSIX compliance): No more socket handles are available for the system. The FuSock_Socket() function may fail if: - ENOBUFS (optional): Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation. The FuSock_Socket() function may also fail in future releases if: - EACCES (optional): The process does not have appropriate privileges. - ENOMEM (optional): Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request. Deviation from POSIX.1-2008: - The error code is uniformly provided via the additional output variable eResult:eResultCode , which contains the values specified by POSIX. The POSIX constructs errno or getlasterror() are not supported. - In certain conditions the system might not be able to deliver differentiated result codes as requested by the POSIX standard. In those cases, where the exact cause cannot be differentiated from other causes, the result codes EUNSPECIFIC and ENOSUCCESS are is returned instead. These codes are not contained in the original POSIX specification. EUNSPECIFIC is used in cases where the system notifies that it cannot differentiate the cause at all ( ERR_FAILED ), while ENOSUCCESS is used when the result code from the system is somewhat differentiated, but cannot be mapped unambiguously to the POSIX requirements. - Actual firmware leaves no way for differenciating between EPROTOTYPE and EPROTONOSUPPORT . Potential mapping would be ambiguous.

Option definitions for use in FuSock_Setsockopt (FUN) and FuSock_Getsockopt (FUN) .

Function Description

Sizes and semantics of the values which are corresponding to the options are quite different for each option and may even vary between implementations:

SO_ACCEPTCONN:

Non-zero indicates that socket listening is enabled (FuSock_Getsockopt() only, length = 4).

The SO_ACCEPTCONN option is used only on getsockopt(). When this option is specified, getsockopt() shall report whether socket listening is enabled for the socket. A value of zero shall indicate that socket listening is disabled; non-zero that it is enabled. SO_ACCEPTCONN has no default value.

SO_BROADCAST:

Non-zero requests permission to transmit broadcast datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM sockets only, length = 4).

The SO_BROADCAST option requests permission to send broadcast datagrams on the socket. Support for SO_BROADCAST is protocol-specific. The default for SO_BROADCAST is that the ability to send broadcast datagrams on a socket is disabled.

Non-zero requests debugging in underlying protocol modules (length = 4).

The SO_DEBUG option enables debugging in the underlying protocol modules. This can be useful for tracing the behavior of the underlying protocol modules during normal system operation. The semantics of the debug reports are implementation-defined. The default value for SO_DEBUG is for debugging to be turned off.

SO_DONTROUTE:

Non-zero requests bypass of normal routing; route based on destination address only (length = 4).

The SO_DONTROUTE option requests that outgoing messages bypass the standard routing facilities. The destination must be on a directly-connected network, and messages are directed to the appropriate network interface according to the destination address. It is protocol-specific whether this option has any effect and how the outgoing network interface is chosen. Support for this option with each protocol is implementation-defined.

Requests and clears pending error information on the socket (FuSock_getsockopt() only, length = 4).

The SO_ERROR option is used only on getsockopt(). When this option is specified, getsockopt() shall return any pending error on the socket and clear the error status. It shall return a value of 0 if there is no pending error. SO_ERROR may be used to check for asynchronous errors on connected connectionless-mode sockets or for other types of asynchronous errors. SO_ERROR has no default value.

SO_KEEPALIVE:

Non-zero requests periodic transmission of keepalive messages (protocol-specific, length = 4).

The SO_KEEPALIVE option enables the periodic transmission of messages on a connected socket. The behavior of this option is protocol-specific. On a connection-mode socket for which a connection has been established, if SO_KEEPALIVE is enabled and the connected socket fails to respond to the keep-alive messages, the connection shall be broken. The default value for SO_KEEPALIVE is zero, specifying that this capability is turned off.

The following three options (TCP_KEEPCNT, TCP_KEEPIDLE, TCP_KEEPINTVL) contain parameters for the keep-alive mechanisms and are typically set up together.

TCP_KEEPCNT:

TCP_KEEPIDLE:

TCP_KEEPINTVL:

Specify actions to be taken for queued, unsent data on FuSock_Close() . Parameter: struct linger .

The SO_LINGER option controls the action of the interface when unsent messages are queued on a socket and a close() is performed. The details of this option are protocol-specific. If SO_LINGER is enabled, the system shall block the calling thread during close() until it can transmit the data or until the end of the interval indicated by the l_linger member, whichever comes first.

If SO_LINGER is not specified, and close() is issued, the system handles the call in a way that allows the calling thread to continue as quickly as possible. The default value for SO_LINGER is zero, or off, for the l_onoff element of the option value and zero seconds for the linger time specified by the l_linger element.

SO_OOBINLINE:

Non-zero requests that out-of-band data be placed into normal data input queue as received. (length = 4)

The SO_OOBINLINE option is valid only on protocols that support out-of-band data. The SO_OOBINLINE option requests that out-of-band data be placed in the normal data input queue as received; it is then accessible using the read() or recv() functions without the MSG_OOB flag set. The default for SO_OOBINLINE is off; that is, for out-of-band data not to be placed in the normal data input queue.

Size of receive buffer in bytes (length = 4).

The SO_RCVBUF option requests that the buffer space allocated for receive operations on this socket be set to the value, in bytes, of the option value. Applications may wish to increase buffer size for high volume connections, or may decrease buffer size to limit the possible backlog of incoming data. The default value for the SO_RCVBUF option value is implementation-defined, and may vary by protocol.

SO_RCVLOWAT:

Minimum amount of data to return to application for input operations in bytes. (length = 4, read-only)

The SO_RCVLOWAT option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket input operations. In general, receive calls block until any (non-zero) amount of data is received, then return the smaller of the amount available or the amount requested. The default value for SO_RCVLOWAT is 1, and does not affect the general case. If SO_RCVLOWAT is set to a larger value, blocking receive calls normally wait until they have received the smaller of the low water mark value or the requested amount. Receive calls may still return less than the low water mark if an error occurs, a signal is caught, or the type of data next in the receive queue is different from that returned (for example, out-of-band data). As mentioned previously, the default value for SO_RCVLOWAT is 1 byte.

It is implementation-defined whether the SO_RCVLOWAT option can be set. In actual firmware, this seems not to be the case.

SO_RCVTIMEO:

Timeout value for a socket receive operation.

The SO_RCVTIMEO option is an option to set a timeout value for input operations. It accepts native Codesys LTIME variable specifying the limit on how long to wait for an input operation to complete. If a receive operation has blocked for this much time without receiving additional data, it shall return with a partial count or EWOULDBLOCK if no data were received. The default for this option is the value zero, which indicates that a receive operation will not time out. It is implementation-defined whether the SO_RCVTIMEO option can be set.

Please note that the timeout which actually comes into effect may be up to 10ms longer than the value given by this option due to target specific firmware implementation.

SO_REUSEADDR:

Non-zero requests reuse of local addresses in bind() (protocol-specific, length = 4)

The SO_REUSEADDR option indicates that the rules used in validating addresses supplied in a bind() should allow reuse of local addresses. Operation of this option is protocol-specific. The default value for SO_REUSEADDR is off; that is, reuse of local addresses is not permitted.

Size of send buffer in bytes. (length = 4)

The SO_SNDBUF option requests that the buffer space allocated for send operations on this socket be set to the value, in bytes, of the option value. The default value for the SO_SNDBUF option value is implementation-defined, and may vary by protocol.

SO_SNDLOWAT:

Minimum amount of data to send for output operations in bytes. (length = 4, readonly)

The SO_SNDLOWAT option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket output operations. Most output operations process all of the data supplied by the call, delivering data to the protocol for transmission and blocking as necessary for flow control. Non-blocking output operations process as much data as permitted subject to flow control without blocking, but process no data if flow control does not allow the smaller of the send low water mark value or the entire request to be processed. A select() operation testing the ability to write to a socket shall return true only if the send low water mark could be processed. The default value for SO_SNDLOWAT is implementation-defined and protocol-specific.

It is implementation-defined whether the SO_SNDLOWAT option can be set. In actual firmware, this seems not to be the case.

SO_SNDTIMEO:

Timeout value for a socket send operation.

The SO_SNDTIMEO option is an option to set a timeout value for the amount of time that an output function shall block because flow control prevents data from being sent. The value is an 8-byte native Codesys LTIME variable. specifying the limit on how long to wait for an output operation to complete. If a send operation has blocked for this much time, it shall return with a partial count or errno set to EWOULDBLOCK if no data were sent. The default for this option is the value zero, which indicates that a send operation will not time out. It is implementation-defined whether the SO_SNDTIMEO option can be set.

Please note that the timeout which actually comes into effect may be up to 10ms longer than the value given by this option due to target specific firmware implementation.

Identify socket type (length = 4, FuSock_getsockopt() only).

The SO_TYPE option is used only on getsockopt(). When this option is specified, getsockopt() shall return the type of the socket (for example, SOCK_STREAM ). This option is useful to servers that inherit sockets on start-up. SO_TYPE has no default value.

IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP:

Subscribes to (â€˜joinsâ€™) a multicast group (write only, Parameter: ip_mreq (STRUCT) )

The element imr_multiaddr contains the address of the multicast group the application wants to join. It must be a valid multicast address (or setsockopt(2) fails with the error EINVAL). imr_address is the address of the local interface with which the system should join the multicast group; if it is equal to INADDR_ANY an appropriate interface is chosen by the system.

IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP:

Unsubscribes from (â€˜leavesâ€™) a multicast group (write only, Parameter: ip_mreq (STRUCT) )

The element imr_multiaddr contains the address of the multicast group the application wants to leave. It must be a valid multicast address (or setsockopt(2) fails with the error EINVAL). imr_address is the address of the local interface with which the system has joined the multicast group; if it is equal to INADDR_ANY an appropriate interface is chosen by the system.

IP_MULTICAST_IF:

IP_MULTICAST_LOOP:

IP_MULTICAST_TTL:

Set or read the time-to-live value of outgoing multicast packets for this socket. (length=4)

It is very important for multicast packets to set the smallest TTL possible. The default is 1 which means that multicast packets donâ€™t leave the local network unless the user program explicitly requests it. Argument is an integer.

TCP_MAXSEG:

TCP_NODELAY:

The destination must be on a directly-connected network, and messages are directed to the appropriate network interface according to the destination address. It is protocol-specific whether this option has any effect and how the outgoing network interface is chosen. Support for this option with each protocol is implementation-defined. SO_ERROR: Requests and clears pending error information on the socket (FuSock_getsockopt() only, length = 4). The SO_ERROR option is used only on getsockopt(). When this option is specified, getsockopt() shall return any pending error on the socket and clear the error status. It shall return a value of 0 if there is no pending error. SO_ERROR may be used to check for asynchronous errors on connected connectionless-mode sockets or for other types of asynchronous errors. SO_ERROR has no default value. SO_KEEPALIVE: Non-zero requests periodic transmission of keepalive messages (protocol-specific, length = 4). The SO_KEEPALIVE option enables the periodic transmission of messages on a connected socket. The behavior of this option is protocol-specific. On a connection-mode socket for which a connection has been established, if SO_KEEPALIVE is enabled and the connected socket fails to respond to the keep-alive messages, the connection shall be broken. The default value for SO_KEEPALIVE is zero, specifying that this capability is turned off. The following three options (TCP_KEEPCNT, TCP_KEEPIDLE, TCP_KEEPINTVL) contain parameters for the keep-alive mechanisms and are typically set up together. TCP_KEEPCNT: The maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. (length=4) TCP_KEEPIDLE: The time in milliseconds(!) the connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes, if the socket option SO_KEEPALIVE has been set on this socket. (Type = TIME, length=4) TCP_KEEPINTVL: The time in milliseconds(!) between individual keepalive probes. (Type = TIME, length=4) SO_LINGER: Specify actions to be taken for queued, unsent data on FuSock_Close() . Parameter: struct linger . The SO_LINGER option controls the action of the interface when unsent messages are queued on a socket and a close() is performed. The details of this option are protocol-specific. If SO_LINGER is enabled, the system shall block the calling thread during close() until it can transmit the data or until the end of the interval indicated by the l_linger member, whichever comes first. If SO_LINGER is not specified, and close() is issued, the system handles the call in a way that allows the calling thread to continue as quickly as possible. The default value for SO_LINGER is zero, or off, for the l_onoff element of the option value and zero seconds for the linger time specified by the l_linger element. SO_OOBINLINE: Non-zero requests that out-of-band data be placed into normal data input queue as received. (length = 4) The SO_OOBINLINE option is valid only on protocols that support out-of-band data. The SO_OOBINLINE option requests that out-of-band data be placed in the normal data input queue as received; it is then accessible using the read() or recv() functions without the MSG_OOB flag set. The default for SO_OOBINLINE is off; that is, for out-of-band data not to be placed in the normal data input queue. SO_RCVBUF: Size of receive buffer in bytes (length = 4). The SO_RCVBUF option requests that the buffer space allocated for receive operations on this socket be set to the value, in bytes, of the option value. Applications may wish to increase buffer size for high volume connections, or may decrease buffer size to limit the possible backlog of incoming data. The default value for the SO_RCVBUF option value is implementation-defined, and may vary by protocol. SO_RCVLOWAT: Minimum amount of data to return to application for input operations in bytes. (length = 4, read-only) The SO_RCVLOWAT option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket input operations. In general, receive calls block until any (non-zero) amount of data is received, then return the smaller of the amount available or the amount requested. The default value for SO_RCVLOWAT is 1, and does not affect the general case. If SO_RCVLOWAT is set to a larger value, blocking receive calls normally wait until they have received the smaller of the low water mark value or the requested amount. Receive calls may still return less than the low water mark if an error occurs, a signal is caught, or the type of data next in the receive queue is different from that returned (for example, out-of-band data). As mentioned previously, the default value for SO_RCVLOWAT is 1 byte. It is implementation-defined whether the SO_RCVLOWAT option can be set. In actual firmware, this seems not to be the case. SO_RCVTIMEO: Timeout value for a socket receive operation. The SO_RCVTIMEO option is an option to set a timeout value for input operations. It accepts native Codesys LTIME variable specifying the limit on how long to wait for an input operation to complete. If a receive operation has blocked for this much time without receiving additional data, it shall return with a partial count or EWOULDBLOCK if no data were received. The default for this option is the value zero, which indicates that a receive operation will not time out. It is implementation-defined whether the SO_RCVTIMEO option can be set. Please note that the timeout which actually comes into effect may be up to 10ms longer than the value given by this option due to target specific firmware implementation. SO_REUSEADDR: Non-zero requests reuse of local addresses in bind() (protocol-specific, length = 4) The SO_REUSEADDR option indicates that the rules used in validating addresses supplied in a bind() should allow reuse of local addresses. Operation of this option is protocol-specific. The default value for SO_REUSEADDR is off; that is, reuse of local addresses is not permitted. SO_SNDBUF: Size of send buffer in bytes. (length = 4) The SO_SNDBUF option requests that the buffer space allocated for send operations on this socket be set to the value, in bytes, of the option value. The default value for the SO_SNDBUF option value is implementation-defined, and may vary by protocol. SO_SNDLOWAT: Minimum amount of data to send for output operations in bytes. (length = 4, readonly) The SO_SNDLOWAT option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket output operations. Most output operations process all of the data supplied by the call, delivering data to the protocol for transmission and blocking as necessary for flow control. Non-blocking output operations process as much data as permitted subject to flow control without blocking, but process no data if flow control does not allow the smaller of the send low water mark value or the entire request to be processed. A select() operation testing the ability to write to a socket shall return true only if the send low water mark could be processed. The default value for SO_SNDLOWAT is implementation-defined and protocol-specific. It is implementation-defined whether the SO_SNDLOWAT option can be set. In actual firmware, this seems not to be the case. SO_SNDTIMEO: Timeout value for a socket send operation. The SO_SNDTIMEO option is an option to set a timeout value for the amount of time that an output function shall block because flow control prevents data from being sent. The value is an 8-byte native Codesys LTIME variable. specifying the limit on how long to wait for an output operation to complete. If a send operation has blocked for this much time, it shall return with a partial count or errno set to EWOULDBLOCK if no data were sent. The default for this option is the value zero, which indicates that a send operation will not time out. It is implementation-defined whether the SO_SNDTIMEO option can be set. Please note that the timeout which actually comes into effect may be up to 10ms longer than the value given by this option due to target specific firmware implementation. SO_TYPE: Identify socket type (length = 4, FuSock_getsockopt() only). The SO_TYPE option is used only on getsockopt(). When this option is specified, getsockopt() shall return the type of the socket (for example, SOCK_STREAM ). This option is useful to servers that inherit sockets on start-up. SO_TYPE has no default value. IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP: Subscribes to (â€˜joinsâ€™) a multicast group (write only, Parameter: ip_mreq (STRUCT) ) The element imr_multiaddr contains the address of the multicast group the application wants to join. It must be a valid multicast address (or setsockopt(2) fails with the error EINVAL). imr_address is the address of the local interface with which the system should join the multicast group; if it is equal to INADDR_ANY an appropriate interface is chosen by the system. IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP: Unsubscribes from (â€˜leavesâ€™) a multicast group (write only, Parameter: ip_mreq (STRUCT) ) The element imr_multiaddr contains the address of the multicast group the application wants to leave. It must be a valid multicast address (or setsockopt(2) fails with the error EINVAL). imr_address is the address of the local interface with which the system has joined the multicast group; if it is equal to INADDR_ANY an appropriate interface is chosen by the system. IP_MULTICAST_IF: Set the local device for a multicast socket. Argument is an in_addr (STRUCT) structure. When an invalid socket option is passed, ENOPROTOOPT is returned. IP_MULTICAST_LOOP: Set or read a boolean integer argument (length=4) that determines whether sent multicast packets should be looped back to the local sockets. IP_MULTICAST_TTL: Set or read the time-to-live value of outgoing multicast packets for this socket. (length=4) It is very important for multicast packets to set the smallest TTL possible. The default is 1 which means that multicast packets donâ€™t leave the local network unless the user program explicitly requests it. Argument is an integer. TCP_MAXSEG: The maximum segment size for outgoing TCP packets. If this option is set before connection establishment, it also changes the MSS value announced to the other end in the initial packet. Values greater than the (eventual) interface MTU have no effect. TCP will also impose its minimum and maximum bounds over the value provided. TCP_NODELAY: If set, disable the Nagle algorithm. This means that segments are always sent as soon as possible, even if there is only a small amount of data. When not set, data is buffered until there is a sufficient amount to send out, thereby avoiding the frequent sending of small packets, which results in poor utilization of the network. Deviation from POSIX.1-2008: - Options SO_RCVDTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO use an native Codesys``LTIME`` argument rather than the composed timeval structure, which is compicated to handle in Codesys (and has smaller range) - Options TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL takes native Codesys``TIME`` arguments rather than the second counting integers specified in other documents. (Which is common use but not specified in POSIX.) Note that the timout value in FuSock_Select (FUN) is consistently also given as LTIME. Caveats: - Options Despite the fact that SO_PROTOTYPE , SO_REUSEPORT , SO_USELOOPBACK are mentioned in the Codesys specification, they are not supported in this library, because they are not supported by actual hardware.

unSockaddr is an ubiquituous address container which corresponds to BSD sockaddr .

Function Description

The sockaddr structure is used to define a socket address which is used in the FuSock_Bind (FUN) , FuSock_Connect (FUN) , FuSock_Recvfrom (FUN) , and FuSock_Sendto (FUN) functions.

Deviation from POSIX.1-2008:

Extensiability:

This definition also allows for later extensions for other address families, as illustrated by the following example:

Here, the user-defined type IEC61850_sockaddr_ll_IPC is passed as input argument to FuSock_Bind() instead of the generic unSockaddr. Attention: The first member of the structure MUST be of type sa_family_t .
