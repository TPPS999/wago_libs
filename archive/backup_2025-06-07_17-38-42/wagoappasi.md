# WagoAppASi v1.7.1.0

## Overview
WAGO PLC library providing WagoAppASi functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Communication protocols
- Professional PLC integration
- Error handling and status reporting

## Core Function Blocks

### FbGeneralCommand
Perform an ASi command

**Description:**
This block allows to perform any ASi command supported by the ASi master module. The command is to be inserted in the input ``aSend`` according to the following definition: aSend[0]: Opcode aSend[1]: Address aSend[2]: data according to Opcode aSend[3]: data according to Opcode aSend[..] ... aSend[9] data according to Opcode The response will be received in the variable ``aReceive`` ,starting at Byte 0 aReceive[0]: data according to Opcode, Byte 3 of mailbox data aReceive[1]: data according to Opcode, Byte 4 of mailbox data aReceive[2]: data according to Opcode, Byte 5 of mailbox data aReceive[3]: data according to Opcode, Byte 6 of mailbox data aReceive[4]: data according to Opcode, Byte 3 or 7 of mailbox data aReceive[5]: data according to Opcode, Byte 4 or 8 of mailbox data aReceive[6]: data according to Opcode, Byte 5 or 9 of mailbox data aReceive[7]: data according to Opcode, Byte 6 or 10 of mailbox data .. note:: This function block must be used to perform any mailbox command mentioned in the manual for the terminal 750-655.

### FbMainAS_Interface
Basic access to the data of the AS Interface master module

**Description:**
This block provides access to the data of the different AS Interface slaves. If mailbox commands are necessary, function block FbGeneralCommand must be used.

### FbReadAnalogInput_7_3
Read input data from a 7.3 ASi Slave

## Data Types

### eStatus
Enumeration type.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```iec
VAR
    fbFbGeneralCommand: FbGeneralCommand;
END_VAR

// Basic function block usage
fbFbGeneralCommand(
    // Configure inputs as needed
);

// Check status
IF fbFbGeneralCommand.xValid THEN
    // Operation successful
END_IF

IF fbFbGeneralCommand.xError THEN
    // Handle error
END_IF
```

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
```iec
IF fbInstance.xError THEN
    CASE fbInstance.eStatus OF
        // Handle specific error codes
    END_CASE
END_IF
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use appropriate polling intervals
- Handle communication errors gracefully
- Consider device response times
- Test thoroughly in target environment
