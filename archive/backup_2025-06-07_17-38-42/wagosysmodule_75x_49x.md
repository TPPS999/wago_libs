## Overview
WAGO PLC library providing WagoSysModule_75x_49x functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Professional PLC integration
- Error handling and status reporting

## Core Function Blocks

### FbModule_75x_495
Access to the power measurement module 750-495 This block is needed for each module. The instance of this function block is either automatically generated by the K-Bus configuration or has to be manually added in case of the dynamic configuration.

### FbModule_75x_494
Access to the power measurement module 750-494 This block is needed for each module. The instance of this function block is either automatically generated by the K-Bus configuration or has to be manually added in case of the dynamic configuration.

### FbModule_75x_493
Access to the power measurement module 750-493 This block is needed for each module. The instance of this function block is either automatically generated by the K-Bus configuration or has to be manually added in case of the dynamic configuration.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```iec
VAR
    fbFbModule_75x_495: FbModule_75x_495;
END_VAR

// Basic function block usage
fbFbModule_75x_495(
    // Configure inputs as needed
);

// Check status
IF fbFbModule_75x_495.xValid THEN
    // Operation successful
END_IF

IF fbFbModule_75x_495.xError THEN
    // Handle error
END_IF
```

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
```iec
IF fbInstance.xError THEN
    CASE fbInstance.eStatus OF
        // Handle specific error codes
    END_CASE
END_IF
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use appropriate polling intervals
- Handle communication errors gracefully
- Consider device response times
- Test thoroughly in target environment
