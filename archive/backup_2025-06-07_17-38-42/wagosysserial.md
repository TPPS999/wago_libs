# WagoSysSerial v1.7.1.0

## Overview
WAGO PLC library providing WagoSysSerial functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Professional PLC integration
- Error handling and status reporting

## Core Function Blocks

### FbSerialInterface
Transmit and receive data via a serial interface. The benefit of this function block is that the parameter ``xTxTrigger`` is not reset before the TxBuffer of a 750-652 is empty. By other modules like 750- 650 / 651 / 653 this parameter will be reset after all bytes are given to the physical module. In this case it may be possible that not alle bytes have been send over the cable because some bytes are still stored in the module. .. note:: You should always call this FB cyclic.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```iec
VAR
    fbFbSerialInterface: FbSerialInterface;
END_VAR

// Basic function block usage
fbFbSerialInterface(
    // Configure inputs as needed
);

// Check status
IF fbFbSerialInterface.xValid THEN
    // Operation successful
END_IF

IF fbFbSerialInterface.xError THEN
    // Handle error
END_IF
```

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
```iec
IF fbInstance.xError THEN
    CASE fbInstance.eStatus OF
        // Handle specific error codes
    END_CASE
END_IF
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use appropriate polling intervals
- Handle communication errors gracefully
- Consider device response times
- Test thoroughly in target environment
