## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```iec
VAR
    fbFbSerialInterface_internal: FbSerialInterface_internal;
END_VAR

// Basic function block usage
fbFbSerialInterface_internal(
    // Configure inputs as needed
);

// Check status
IF fbFbSerialInterface_internal.xValid THEN
    // Operation successful
END_IF

IF fbFbSerialInterface_internal.xError THEN
    // Handle error
END_IF
```

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
```iec
IF fbInstance.xError THEN
    CASE fbInstance.eStatus OF
        // Handle specific error codes
    END_CASE
END_IF
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use appropriate polling intervals
- Handle communication errors gracefully
- Consider device response times
- Test thoroughly in target environment
