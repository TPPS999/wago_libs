A controller with autotune functionality designed for general control with an analog manipulated output

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This module represents a process controller with six different phases. Enabling the autotune functionality the first time is done by activating input xEnable and xEnableAutoTune at the same time.

Phase 1) Settling phase ->internal state 5

In this phase, the controlled system is supplied with a set value the size of typConfiguration.iP5StartLevel . Depending on the configuration value xUseLevelAsAbsoluteValue iP5StartLevel is used as absolute or as %-value from the setpoint.

The system then waits until the system is in a stable state.

This phase can also be used to bring the system close to the actual operating point. This is particularly important when the controlled system is non-linear, so that subsequent identification can determine the real behavior at the operating point as well as possible.

Phase 2) Identification phase ->internal state 10

In this phase, the controlled system is supplied with a set value the size of typConfiguration.iP10IdentLevel . Depending on the configuration value xUseLevelAsAbsoluteValue iP10IdentLevel is used as absolute or as %-value from the setpoint. The waveform of the controlled system response is recorded. The module returns an error if the step response cannot be recorded completely. Such is the case if the internal memory is too small. In this case, the error message is ArrayTooSmall . The rY output is reset to zero by default. The problem can be resolved by increasing the tSampleRate sampling rate or increasing the MAX_IDENTIFICATION_ARRAY parameter.

At the end of the identification phase, the controlled system parameters are determined using the inflectional tangent method.

The output point for the control parameters represents the determined data set ( rKs , rTu and rTg ).

Evaluating both typConfiguration.iP10StationaryEndpointControlTime and typConfiguration.rP10StationaryEndpointPercentReferenceValue inputs determines when the stationary end value is reached during the identification phase. If the process value does not change more than the typConfiguration.rP10StationaryEndpointPercentReferenceValue percent within the specified time, it is assumed that the stationary end value has been reached.

This module also allows you to interrupt identification early or to start calculating the controller parameters immediately. This can be useful if the stationary end value is reached very slowly. In this case, the operator can estimate the end value from the rStationaryEndvalue input directly and trigger calculation by the xReleasedByOperator input.

Phase 3) Controlling the intermediate setpoint ->internal state 20

Following the identification phase, the system reaches a specific process value. The process difference from the setpoint actually specified is determined. In this phase, the control parameters are set to an intermediate setpoint that is 50 % of the process difference. Therefore, you have the option of roughly estimating the quality of the control parameters.

Phase 4) Controlling the setpoint ->internal state 30

In this phase, the specified setpoint is controlled with the calculated control parameters. The quality of the control must be assessed by the operator and improved by manual optimization, if necessary. It is recommended to use the trace functionality to get a visual impression of the process profile.

The system switches to phase 5 once the setpoint is reached.

Phase 5) Maintain setpoint (regulating disturbance variables) ->internal state 40

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typConfiguration.eP40ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_dis . If a new setpoint is identified, the system switches to phase 6.

Phase 6) Regulating the setpoint step change ->internal state 50

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typConfiguration.eP50ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_set . Once the new setpoint is reached with the corresponding accuracy, the system switches to phase 5.

Since the controlled system gain is unknown during initial identification, the process value is monitored using the typConfiguration.rP10MaxProcessValueWhileIdentification configuration value.

When the process value threshold is reached, the output is reset to zero and the identification process terminated. However, the process value can still rise further due to the properties of the controlled system. With that said, the process value threshold should be selected as low as possible to preclude any damage due to impermissible high process values. If an error interrupts identification, the function block must be disabled once. You can then restart with a reduced value for typConfiguration.iP10IdentLevel .

This module can also be used as a traditional PID controller if the xUseExternalControlParameter is set to TRUE. In this case, the controller operates with the rKp , rTn and rTv input values.

A second identification phase is only performed if the difference between the current process value and the new setpoint rSetPointValue is at least typConfiguration.rMinProcessDifference .

This module also allows you to interrupt identification early or to start calculating the controller parameters immediately. This can be useful if the stationary end value is reached very slowly. In this case, the operator can estimate the end value from the rStationaryEndvalue input directly and trigger calculation by the xReleasedByOperator input.

Phase 3) Controlling the intermediate setpoint ->internal state 20

Following the identification phase, the system reaches a specific process value. The process difference from the setpoint actually specified is determined. In this phase, the control parameters are set to an intermediate setpoint that is 50 % of the process difference. Therefore, you have the option of roughly estimating the quality of the control parameters.

Phase 4) Controlling the setpoint ->internal state 30

In this phase, the specified setpoint is controlled with the calculated control parameters. The quality of the control must be assessed by the operator and improved by manual optimization, if necessary. It is recommended to use the trace functionality to get a visual impression of the process profile.

The system switches to phase 5 once the setpoint is reached.

Phase 5) Maintain setpoint (regulating disturbance variables) ->internal state 40

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typConfiguration.eP40ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_dis . If a new setpoint is identified, the system switches to phase 6.

Phase 6) Regulating the setpoint step change ->internal state 50

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typConfiguration.eP50ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_set . Once the new setpoint is reached with the corresponding accuracy, the system switches to phase 5.

Since the controlled system gain is unknown during initial identification, the process value is monitored using the typConfiguration.rP10MaxProcessValueWhileIdentification configuration value.

When the process value threshold is reached, the output is reset to zero and the identification process terminated. However, the process value can still rise further due to the properties of the controlled system. With that said, the process value threshold should be selected as low as possible to preclude any damage due to impermissible high process values. If an error interrupts identification, the function block must be disabled once. You can then restart with a reduced value for typConfiguration.iP10IdentLevel .

This module can also be used as a traditional PID controller if the xUseExternalControlParameter is set to TRUE. In this case, the controller operates with the rKp , rTn and rTv input values.

A second identification phase is only performed if the difference between the current process value and the new setpoint rSetPointValue is at least typConfiguration.rMinProcessDifference .

This is particularly important when the controlled system is non-linear, so that subsequent identification can determine the real behavior at the operating point as well as possible.

The module returns an error if the step response cannot be recorded completely. Such is the case if the internal memory is too small. In this case, the error message is ArrayTooSmall . The rY output is reset to zero by default. The problem can be resolved by increasing the tSampleRate sampling rate or increasing the MAX_IDENTIFICATION_ARRAY parameter. At the end of the identification phase, the controlled system parameters are determined using the inflectional tangent method.

Function Description

This module allows identification of a controlled system. However, a non-oscillating, non-integrating controlled system is required. The eControlledSystem input must therefore always be operated with the eControlledSystem.PTn value (additional controlled system types shall be added in the future).

Identification may only be started if the system is in a steady state. Otherwise, the values are calculated incorrectly. If the module is enabled by the xEnable input, identification is started by a change at the rSetPoint input. The xManualOperation input allows to supply the controlled system manually with the value rSetPoint without the identification being carried out. This can be useful, so that identification is only executed in the vicinity of the real operating point (linearization of a nonlinear distance around the operating point). If identification is started, make sure that the rManipulatedValueAtStart input is connected correctly. If this input has an incorrect value, identification of the rKs gain factor of the controlled system is calculated incorrectly.

The default for rSetPoint must be selected to prevent damage to the controlled system. Corresponding monitoring functions must be added to the user program.

If there is no accurate knowledge of the behavior of the controlled system, start with low values for rSetPoint to get a first impression.

This module maps the real controlled system behavior by PTn approximation.

The output point for the control parameters represents the data set (rKs, rTu and rTg). The module makes the values possible for the selected eControllerType available at the aValues output. Assignment is as follows:

aValues[0] ->Ziegler, extended Ziegler-Nichols method

aValues[1] ->CHR_aperiodisch_dis, Chien/Hrones and Reswick, aperiodic disturbance response

aValues[2] ->CHR_aperiodisch_dis, Chien/Hrones and Reswick, aperiodic response to setpoint changes

aValues[3] ->CHR_20_dis, Chien/Hrones and Reswick, aperiodic disturbance response with 20 % overshoot

aValues[4] ->CHR_20_dis, Chien/Hrones and Reswick, aperiodic response to setpoint changes with 20 % overshoot

Only non-integrating systems are currently supported.

This module returns an error if the step response cannot be recorded completely. Such is the case if the internal memory is too small. In this case, the error message is ArrayTooSmall . The rValue output is reset to zero in this case. The problem can be resolved by increasing the tSampleRate sampling rate or increasing the MAX_IDENTIFICATION_ARRAY parameter.

This module also allows you to interrupt identification early or to start calculating the controller parameters immediately. This can be useful if the stationary end value is reached very slowly. In this case, the operator can estimate the end value from the rStationaryEndvalue input directly and trigger calculation by the xReleasedByOperator input.

Evaluating both iStationaryEndpointControlTime and rSetPointReachedLimit inputs determines when the stationary end value is reached during the identification phase. If the process value does not change more than the rSetPointReachedLimit percent within the specified time, it is assumed that the stationary end value has been reached.

A controller with autotune functionality designed for temperature control with an analog manipulated output

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This module represents a temperature controller with six different phases.

Phase 1) Settling phase ->internal state 5

In this phase, the controlled system is supplied with a set value the size of typTempConfiguration.iP5StartLevel . Depending on the configuration value xUseLevelAsAbsoluteValue iP5StartLevel is used as absolute or as %-value from the setpoint.

The system then waits until the system is in a stable state.

This phase can also be used to bring the system close to the actual operating point. This is particularly important when the controlled system is non-linear, so that subsequent identification can determine the real behavior at the operating point as well as possible.

Phase 2) Identification phase ->internal state 10

In this phase, the controlled system is supplied with a set value the size of typTempConfiguration.iP10IdentLevel . Depending on the configuration value xUseLevelAsAbsoluteValue iP10IdentLevel is used as absolute or as %-value from the setpoint. The waveform of the controlled system response is recorded. The module returns an error if the step response cannot be recorded completely. Such is the case if the internal memory is too small. In this case, the error message is ArrayTooSmall . The rY output is reset to zero by default. The problem can be resolved by increasing the tSampleRate sampling rate or increasing the MAX_IDENTIFICATION_ARRAY parameter.

At the end of the identification phase, the controlled system parameters are determined using the inflectional tangent method.

The output point for the control parameters represents the determined data set ( rKs , rTu and rTg ).

Evaluating both typTempConfiguration.iP10StationaryEndpointControlTime and typTempConfiguration.rP10StationaryEndpointPercentReferenceValue inputs determines when the stationary end value is reached during the identification phase. If the process value does not change more than the typTempConfiguration.rP10StationaryEndpointPercentReferenceValue percent within the specified time, it is assumed that the stationary end value has been reached.

This module also allows you to interrupt identification early or to start calculating the controller parameters immediately. This can be useful if the stationary end value is reached very slowly. In this case, the operator can estimate the end value from the rStationaryEndvalue input directly and trigger calculation by the xReleasedByOperator input.

Phase 3) Controlling the intermediate setpoint ->internal state 20

Following the identification phase, the system reaches a specific temperature. The temperature difference from the setpoint actually specified is determined. In this phase, the control parameters are set to an intermediate setpoint that is 50 % of the temperature difference. Therefore, you have the option of roughly estimating the quality of the control parameters.

Phase 4) Controlling the setpoint ->internal state 30

In this phase, the specified setpoint is controlled with the calculated control parameters. The quality of the control must be assessed by the operator and improved by manual optimization, if necessary. It is recommended to use the trace functionality to get a visual impression of the temperature profile.

The system switches to phase 5 once the setpoint is reached.

Phase 5) Maintain setpoint (regulating disturbance variables) ->internal state 40

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typTempConfiguration.eP40ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_dis . If a new setpoint is identified, the system switches to phase 6.

Phase 6) Regulating the setpoint step change ->internal state 50

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typTempConfiguration.eP50ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_set . Once the new setpoint is reached with the corresponding accuracy, the system switches to phase 5.

Since the controlled system gain is unknown during initial identification, the temperature is monitored using the typTempConfiguration.rP10MaxTemperatureWhileIdentification configuration value.

When the temperature threshold is reached, the output is reset to zero and the identification process terminated. However, the process temperature can still rise further due to the properties of the controlled system. With that said, the temperature threshold should be selected as low as possible to preclude any damage due to impermissible high temperatures. If an error interrupts identification, the function block must be disabled once. You can then restart with a reduced value for typTempConfiguration.iP10IdentLevel .

This module can also be used as a traditional PID controller if the xUseExternalControlParameter is set to TRUE. In this case, the controller operates with the rKp , rTn and rTv input values.

A second identification phase is only performed if the temperature difference between the current temperature and the new setpoint rSetPointValue it greater than typTempConfiguration.rMinProcessDifference .

Function Description

This module represents a temperature controller with six different phases.

Phase 1) Settling phase ->internal state 5

In this phase, the controlled system is supplied with a set value the size of typTempConfiguration.iP5StartLevel . The system then waits until the system is in a stable state.

This phase can also be used to bring the system close to the actual operating point. This is particularly important when the controlled system is non-linear, so that subsequent identification can determine the real behavior at the operating point as well as possible.

Phase 2) Identification phase ->internal state 10

In this phase, the controlled system is supplied with a set value the size of typTempConfiguration.iP10IdentLevel . The waveform of the controlled system response is recorded. The module returns an error if the step response cannot be recorded completely. Such is the case if the internal memory is too small. In this case, the error message is ArrayTooSmall . The xPWM output is reset to zero. The problem can be resolved by increasing the tSampleRate sampling rate or increasing the MAX_IDENTIFICATION_ARRAY parameter.

At the end of the identification phase, the controlled system parameters are determined using the inflectional tangent method.

The output point for the control parameters represents the determined data set ( rKs , rTu and rTg ).

Evaluating both typTempConfiguration.iP10StationaryEndpointControlTime and typTempConfiguration.rP10StationaryEndpointPercentReferenceValue inputs determines when the stationary end value is reached during the identification phase. If the process value does not change more than the typTempConfiguration.rP10StationaryEndpointPercentReferenceValue percent within the specified time, it is assumed that the stationary end value has been reached.

This module also allows you to interrupt identification early or to start calculating the controller parameters immediately. This can be useful if the stationary end value is reached very slowly. In this case, the operator can estimate the end value from the rStationaryEndvalue input directly and trigger calculation by the xReleasedByOperator input.

Phase 3) Controlling the intermediate setpoint ->internal state 20

Following the identification phase, the system reaches a specific temperature. The temperature difference from the setpoint actually specified is determined. In this phase, the control parameters are set to an intermediate setpoint that is 50 % of the temperature difference. Therefore, you have the option of roughly estimating the quality of the control parameters.

Phase 4) Controlling the setpoint ->internal state 30

In this phase, the specified setpoint is controlled with the calculated control parameters. The quality of the control must be assessed by the operator and improved by manual optimization, if necessary. It is recommended to use the trace functionality to get a visual impression of the temperature profile.

The system switches to phase 5 once the setpoint is reached.

Phase 5) Maintain setpoint (regulating disturbance variables) ->internal state 40

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typTempConfiguration.eP40ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_dis . If a new setpoint is identified, the system switches to phase 6.

Phase 6) Regulating the setpoint step change ->internal state 50

The controller operates with the controller set determined by the typTempConfiguration.eP50ControlMethode configuration value. The default value is CHR_aperiodisch_set . Once the new setpoint is reached with the corresponding accuracy, the system switches to phase 5.

Since the controlled system gain is unknown during initial identification, the temperature is monitored using the typTempConfiguration.rP10MaxTemperatureWhileIdentification configuration value.

When the temperature threshold is reached, the output is reset to zero and the identification process terminated. However, the process temperature can still rise further due to the properties of the controlled system. With that said, the temperature threshold should be selected as low as possible to preclude any damage due to impermissible high temperatures. If an error interrupts identification, the function block must be disabled once. You can then restart with a reduced value for typTempConfiguration.iP10IdentLevel .

This module can also be used as a traditional PID controller if the xUseExternalControlParameter is set to TRUE. In this case, the controller operates with the rKp , rTn and rTv input values.

A second identification phase is only performed if the temperature difference between the current temperature and the new setpoint rSetPointValue it greater than typTempConfiguration.rMinProcessDifference .

A PID controller in the additive control structure

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This module represents a controller that allows diverse controller types, e.g., PID or PI, by selecting the rKp , rTn and rTv inputs.

The output value can be limited to the range from rOutputMin to rOutputMax . If the controller is operated with a digital output via a PWM module, the limiting values must be set to rOutputMin=0 and rOutputMax=100.

An AntiWindUp of the integral gain is always realized. rOutputMin and rOutputMax are also used as limiting values. Manual operation is realized via the xManualOperation input. Switching to automatic mode is hitchless.

If the controller is disabled, the size of the setpoint is determined by the configuration of the typConfiguration.eDisableMode and typConfiguration.rDisabledOutput , if necessary. The output is reset to zero by default.

If the rate time of the controller modeled on a real rate time instead of the ideal rate time, corresponding damping can be realized via typConfiguration.rTdamping .

You can configure other options via the typConfiguration input. typConfiguration.xUseP_Modified allows the proportional multiplier to act on the process value instead of on the deviation from the setpoint. The same applies to the rate time via typConfiguration.xUseD_Modified .

## doc10_SystemProperties (FB)


Using the modules of this library requires basic knowledge of control engineering and can only be used by appropriately trained employees.

This library provides basic function blocks for control engineering applications. The General folder contains general modules.

There is also a universal PID controller and two specialized controllers for temperature control. These modules are in the Controller folder. If the basic options of these modules are inadequate in specific applications, additional properties can be provided by the addition of basic modules. If the setpoint is offset by noise, it can be useful to add the FuDeadZone function before the setpoint.

Temperature controls are generally slow. Therefore, a sampling time of 1 or 2 seconds is usually sufficient for such processes. If the sampling time is very short and the MAX_IDENTIFICATION_ARRAY parameter is too small, an error occurs because the step response cannot be recorded completely in this case.

Temperature controls often require a large rate time for good control. However, this also increases the sensitivity to noisy input signals at the same time. In this case, you have to think about using a filter.

In case of temperature control with a digital output, the FbTemperatureControlPWM_01 module is to be used. It should be noted that this module is used in a task that has a significantly higher execution time than the sampling time for the actual control specified at the module.

A value ranging from 10 ms to 100 ms is suitable in most cases.

The FbControlledSystemIdentification_01 function block permits the identification of a controlled system according to the inflectional tangent method. However, it requires a controlled system that has non-integrating behavior as well as no oscillating behavior, e.g., heating a furnace.

This version of the library currently only supports identification of non-oscillating, non-integrating controlled systems.

It is recommended to use the trace functionality of the system to roughly verify the determined values.

The Fb_PID function block operates according to the sum formula shown in the following figure:

If the call interval of the control tasks is changed, the project must be recompiled and loaded again. An online change is not supported for this change.

The sample rate must be assigend by the user.
