## _CalcCalendarWeek (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | _CalcCalendarWeek | eResultCode |  |
| Input | uiYear | UINT | Year (e.g. 2006) |
| uiDayOfWeek | UINT | Day of week (1..7: Monday = 1, Sunday = 7 |
| uiYday | UINT | Day of year (1..365): January 1 = 1, [...] |
| Output | uiWeekOfYear | UINT | Calendar Week according to ISO8601 |
| iYearOffsetForWoY | INT | Offset for the year when near year boundaries. |

| result codes |
| Ok | Success (nothing else is returned here). |

Calculates the calendar week to a given date.

The output iYearOffsetForWoY is normally 0, -1 if the week is the last week of previous year, and +1 if the week is the first week of following year. E.g.: Dez-31-2015 is CW 01-2016, which is an offset of +1.

Attention: This function expects preprocessed input (correct day-of-week matching to day-of-year).
