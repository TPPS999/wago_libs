### Other Components


## FbProcessorLoad.IsThreshold1Reached (PROP)


Is load above Threshold1 ?

Is load above Threshold1 ?

## FbProcessorLoad.IsThreshold2Reached (PROP)


Is load above Threshold2 ?

Is load above Threshold2 ?

## FbProcessorLoad.LogLevel (PROP) Â¶


## FbProcessorLoad.OverloadAction (PROP)


OverloadAction

## FbProcessorLoad.ProcessorLoad (PROP)


Current processor load in percent

Update in FW 27 for multicore systems:

On Multicore systems the return value is modified to represent a significant system load.

To represent this the highest load of all cores is evaluated

Three levels of system load are distinguished:

1: all core loads are below 50% > the average load is resulted 2: highest core load is above 50 % > then medium value between the highest and the average value is the result 3: highest core load is above 75% > the highest core load is resulted
