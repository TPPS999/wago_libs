Function description

This function allows to execute a command in shell context (not every shell command is possible)

When the time defined with tTimeout has expired, the function returns via pResult ERR_TIMEOUT. The shell command will continue to be processed until it is finished. It is only possible to perform one shell command at the same time.

The function returns the return code of the executed command. The function itself returns result codes via pResult.

The following result codes from CmpErrors.Errors are possible.

Example of a simple command execution.
