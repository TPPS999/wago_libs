# WagoAppSerial_ebmBus v1.6.2.1

## Overview
WAGO PLC library providing WagoAppSerial_ebmBus functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Professional PLC integration
- Error handling and status reporting

## Core Function Blocks

### FbVisuData
### FbEbmBusMaster
This function block supports the control of ebmBus slaves. To use this functions you have to fill the structure ``utRequest`` and after that to set ``xTrigger`` for once. If the job is done ``xTrigger`` will be reset automaticly by the function block and you should check ``xError``. If no error occurs you can get the response at the structure ``utResponse``. Otherwise you can ask ``oStatus`` for more information about the error. For the available services of your slave please read the manual of your slave. .. note:: You have to call the FbEbmBusMaster cyclic.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```iec
VAR
    fbFbVisuData: FbVisuData;
END_VAR

// Basic function block usage
fbFbVisuData(
    // Configure inputs as needed
);

// Check status
IF fbFbVisuData.xValid THEN
    // Operation successful
END_IF

IF fbFbVisuData.xError THEN
    // Handle error
END_IF
```

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
```iec
IF fbInstance.xError THEN
    CASE fbInstance.eStatus OF
        // Handle specific error codes
    END_CASE
END_IF
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use appropriate polling intervals
- Handle communication errors gracefully
- Consider device response times
- Test thoroughly in target environment
