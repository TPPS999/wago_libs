The Function Blocks FbAppLED provides access to one of the App-LEDs of the controller in various operating modes.

Function Description

This Fb implements the behaviour model WagoChannel in order to coordinate access to the LEDs from different places within the application program. A TRUE state at the input xOpen opens the access to the LED and a FALSE state closes it again. (For a general description of this model, please refer to FbBehaviourModel_WagoChannel ).

Before using a App-LED, the ID of the App LED has to be passed to the input FbAppLED.eID . While using a App-LED, the xOpen -Input has to be kept TRUE . If eID denotes an LED which does not exist on the given hardware, the result code ENOENT and xError=TRUE appears at the status output.

The FB signals its operational state with its output xIsOpen .

The operation mode of an LED can be altered anytime the FB is open. If this change of operation mode is likely to give misleading LED signals to the user (e.g. because a sequence or a flash is in progress) this situation is indicated with the output xBusy . Nevertheless, this is a just warning, which may be overridden by the application.

If xOpen returns to FALSE again, the access to the LED is cut. Please note that the state of the LED itself ( on or off ) remains unchanged.

If it is desired to switch the LED to any default states at opening or closing, the user is advised to derive his own FB from this base and place this specialized functionality into his overloaded methods protOpen and protClose which are inherited from the base model WagoAppChannel .

The functionblock FbAppLED_SetFlash_cpt() displays a color for a short time and displays a second color statically afterwards.

Graphical Illustration

Function description

If xEnable true, then the color of this â€˜flashâ€™ is given by eColor1 and its duration is given by tFlashTime . After tFlashTime has elapsed, the LED displays the other color eColor2 (which may be a visible color as well as simply off ). A falling edge at xEnable stop the execution and switch off th LED, for a new execution or a parameter change a rising edge at xEnable is necessary.

The stauts output xBusy is set, while xEnable is set and the functionblock is still in progress. The status output xValid indicate a successful operation, it will be rest with a falling edge at xEnable . The status output xError indicate a problem in the execution of the functionblock, it will be reset one cycle after xBusy was reset.

While the first phase of the flash is in progress, the xBusy -Output of the FB is TRUE .

When applying this function while the LED is still â€˜flashâ€™ing, the flash time will be retriggered.

When the flash time is expired, the LED transits into the static mode.

Some legacy libraries require the LED to be driven into in certain other operating modes (namely â€˜staticâ€™) before the LED could be driven to flash mode. This FB, however, has no such restriction.

On error, no change of the LED state takes place.

For the PFCX00-System are only the Colors Green, Red and Yello supported.

The functionblock FbAppLED_SetOn_cpt() switches the LED to a device specific color which is guaranteed to be visible.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This functionblock is similar to FbAppLED_SetStatic_cpt() , but it guarantees that the LED will turn on in some default color. When using FbAppLED_SetStatic_cpt() in contrast, the user may select the color, but the LED will not turn on if he selects a color which cannot be displayed (e.g. blue on a red-green-LED). A falling edge at xEnable stop the execution and switch off th LED, for a new execution or a parameter change a rising edge at xEnable is necessary.

The stauts output xBusy is set, while xEnable is set and the functionblock is still in progress. The status output xValid indicate a successful operation, it will be rest with a falling edge at xEnable . The status output xError indicate a problem in the execution of the functionblock, it will be reset one cycle after xBusy was reset.

Which color is used as default color depends on the target hardware and on the type of the LED. It is hardcoded in the target depending internal libraries and cannot be changed by the user. It is ensured that the default color is visible for the addressed target hardware.

On error, no change of the LED state takes place.

For the PFCX00-System are only the Colors Green, Red and Yello supported.

The functionblock FbAppLED_SetSequence_cpt() starts the display of a blink code for indicating a specific status or error condition.

Graphical Illustration

Function description

Each pulse of the sequence has an individually settable duration and color. If off-phases are required between the pulses, these off-phases have to be represented by an individual sequence step with color off .

The input pSequence points to an array of sequence steps ( typLedSequenceStep (STRUCT) ). This array has a variable length which is denoted by udiSequenceSize . When a sequence step carries a duration of 0, this also denotes the end of the sequence, even if udiSequenceSize indicates more steps.

Once initiated, the sequence cannot be altered - but it can be stopped or restarted instead. While the sequence is in progress, the xBusy -Output of the FB is TRUE .

After the sequence has terminated, the LED transits to the static mode and displays the color of the last sequence step (i.e. the one with T#0s , when the sequence contains such a step).

A falling edge at xEnable stop the execution and switch off th LED, for a new execution or a parameter change a rising edge at xEnable is necessary.

The stauts output xBusy is set, while xEnable is set and the functionblock is still in progress. The status output xValid indicate a successful operation, it will be rest with a falling edge at xEnable . The status output xError indicate a problem in the execution of the functionblock, it will be reset one cycle after xBusy was reset.

For the PFCX00-System are only the Colors Green, Red and Yello supported.

The method SetFlash() displays a color for a short time and displays a second color statically afterwards.

Graphical Illustration

Function description

The color of this â€˜flashâ€™ is given by eColor1 and its duration is given by tFlashTime . After tFlashTime has elapsed, the LED displays the other color eColor2 (which may be a visible color as well as simply off ).

While the first phase of the flash is in progress, the xBusy -Output of the FB is TRUE .

When applying this function while the LED is still â€˜flashâ€™ing, the flash time will be retriggered.

When the flash time is expired, the LED transits into the static mode.

Some legacy libraries require the LED to be driven into in certain other operating modes (namely â€˜staticâ€™) before the LED could be driven to flash mode. This FB, however, has no such restriction.

On error, no change of the LED state takes place.

For the PFCX00-System are only the Colors Green, Red and Yello supported.

The method SetOn() switches the LED to a device specific color which is guaranteed to be visible.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This method is similar to setStatic() , but it guarantees that the LED will turn on in some default color. When using setStatic() in contrast, the user may select the color, but the LED will not turn on if he selects a color which cannot be displayed (e.g. blue on a red-green-LED).

Which color is used as default color depends on the target hardware and on the type of the LED. It is hardcoded in the target depending internal libraries and cannot be changed by the user. It is ensured that the default color is visible for the addressed target hardware.

On error, no change of the LED state takes place.

For the PFCX00-System are only the Colors Green, Red and Yello supported.

The method SetSequence() starts the display of a blink code for indicating a specific status or error condition.

Graphical Illustration

Function description

Each pulse of the sequence has an individually settable duration and color. If off-phases are required between the pulses, these off-phases have to be represented by an individual sequence step with color off .

The input pSequence points to an array of sequence steps ( typLedSequenceStep (STRUCT) ). This array has a variable length which is denoted by udiSequenceSize . When a sequence step carries a duration of 0, this also denotes the end of the sequence, even if udiSequenceSize indicates more steps.

Once initiated, the sequence cannot be altered - but it can be stopped or restarted instead. While the sequence is in progress, the xBusy -Output of the FB is TRUE .

After the sequence has terminated, the LED transits to the static mode and displays the color of the last sequence step (i.e. the one with T#0s , when the sequence contains such a step).

For the PFCX00-System are only the Colors Green, Red and Yello supported.

The method UpdateSequence() assigns a new typLedSequenceStep -pointer to the FbAppLED while the blink sequence is still in progress.

Graphical Illustration

Function description

If a null pointer is given for the new sequence address, the sequence will be aborted.

This method does not fail and thus does not return any result code. It may also be called while no sequence is in progress, but it has no immediate effect then until the new sequence starts.

This method must be called at Online-Change by the embedding FB it it uses blink sequences, because at Online-Change absolute locations may change and pointers have to be updated afterwards.

This Method may be called even if the FB is not open, because it does not initiate any action.
