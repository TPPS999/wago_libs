### Methods


## Fb_GenericRunner.run (METH)


| Scope | Name | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return | run | eResultCode |

This method is called when the runner is executed.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This method is expected to be implemented (overwritten) by derived classes.

In this fundamental state of definition, no assumptions are made for return values. Thus, if not used, the return value might have undefined behaviour.

It is, however, good paractice to return at least 0=ok even if the return value is omitted, becaused derived FBs might interprete the result code.

Operation return status, according to POSIX.1 (1996 edition).

This list closely reflects the Posix definitions of error symbols which are used commonly in lots of situations and which should more or less cover a majority of standard situations. They are used here for the sake of international standardization.

When functions report errors, however, typically only a small subset of these codes are used by a single function or function block. So, although the general meaning of these codes is listed here, the header of each function SHOULD contain a list of the result codes which are actually used there together with a description of the circumstances in which that function will return a specific code.

When a function gets result codes from other functions, it is normally very bad style to pass this result code upwards without further analysis of the code, because the results might be not well-specified. Instead, the result code SHOULD be analyzed internally and mapped to that result code set which is specified in the header.

Returning Result Codes

A large variety of different methods for returning status codes could be found in existing Codesys-code. For the sake of uniform handling, however, when a result code is involved in functions or methods, it should be returned as primary return value:

Other results of the function are to be returned via VAR_OUTPUT or VAR_IN_OUT, whereas the information about failure or success is given by standard via the primary return value.

Deprecated style: Another frequently seen sheme which involves pointers to a result variable is strongly deprecated:

Reason: When using this sheme, it remains pretty unclear,

This style SHOULD NOT be used in new code. It is strongly encouraged to port legacy code to standard behaviour.

Note: There are lots of situations where handling of a result code in simple functions is not necessary. In these cases the primary return value may carry the processed value directly, while minor error conditions would lead to certain default values of the result:

In case of passing a nullpointer, just an empty string might be returned and a result code is not necessary in most applications.

Documentation of Result Codes

When result codes are returned, typically only a small fraction of the possible range of codes is used by a single function. For the object which returns error codes, it must be individually documented, which error codes could be expected at all (a general reference to the list of all codes, although that is common practice in Codesys, is not sufficient). E.g.:

Application specific result codes

While the standard codes are expected to cover most standard situations, specialized libraries might need individual result codes. For this purpose, the code range 200..999 is reserved for local individual extentions.

The result code EAPP (=200) denotes the begin of the application specific code range.

Note: Codes in this range are specific to the library which introduce it. These codes will not be registered centrally, so other libraries may use the same range of numbers if their authors do not cooperate. If global uniqueness of user defined result codes would be required, it would be apprropriate, to embed the resultcodes into an FbError -Object (WagoAppErrorBase.library)

Unfortunately, actual Codesys compilers do not allow ‚ÄúEXTENDS‚Äù to an enumeration, but a number of feasible ways exist to smoothly integrate individual codes into eResultCodes as shown below.

eSchedMode := eSchedulingMode.Background;                                  // regular assignment

This enumeration controls the details of asynchronous scheduling of an FB.

Function Description

This type is used as input parameter for asynchronous scheduling of jobs. The following values are used:

Various PLCs allow to schedule the execution of tasks synchronous to certain external events. It depends on the hardware which events are supported. An additional enumeration eSchedulingModeEvent is provided via the device description. The values from this enumeration may be safely inserted when eSchedulingMode is expected.

In order to avoid false warnings, a type cast function is also provided from the library that provides specific scheduling modes:

Triggering on external events with additional prioritizing:

Some target hardware allows for combining external events with additional scheduling priority. In this case, the wrapping function SchedulingMode_EventPriority() is to be used for combining both to a single scheduling mode value:

Other values than these are reserved for future usage and MUST NOT be used. When scheduling modes are used in applications, however, they must always be referred to by symbolic names, never by plain numbers.

(The type casts SchedulingMode() and SchedulingMode_EventPriority() are defined in the target specific library resolved by the placeholder WagoTypesAsyncInternal . They are automatically loaded together with WagoSysAsync.library .)

In certain very special situations the function SchedulingMode_EventPriority() might be fed with other priorities than defined here. In those cases it MUST be crosschecked against the library WagoTypesAsync_Internal_~ if those exceptional values are valid.

InOut: Function This enumeration controls the details of asynchronous scheduling of an FB. Function Description This type is used as input parameter for asynchronous scheduling of jobs. The following values are used: eSchedulingMode.Synchronous: This mode represents execution within the synchrounous IEC task context. The execution is not deferred to other tasks, but takes place immediatelly after calling and blocks the calling application during execution. Note: This mode is mostly used when developing own asnchronous FBs. eSchedulingMode.RealTimeHigh (=1): Execution in a different asynchronous task with runs priorized over the IEC task but subordinate to tasks for external interfaces. Latency in the RealTime-scheduling group is expected to be substatially low, because execution could not be delayed by external interface tasks. In contrast, tasks with priority 1-3 might possibly delay external interfaces. Thus, this mode is not advisable for long running tasks. eSchedulingMode.RealTimeMedium/Low (=2/3): These modes denote the essentially similar to RealTimeHigh, but with lower priority. These tasks will not delay RealTimeHigh-tasks, but could be delayed by them. eSchedulingMode.AsyncHigh (=4): Tasks in this mode will not block field bus communication, but could be delayed by field bussed. Latency in this mode might be high, because execution might be delayed by external influences - such as field busses. eSchedulingMode.AsyncMedium/Low (=7/14): Same properties as AsyncHigh but with subordinate priority. In typical scenarios, visualization applications (which need not to be realtime but should keep a minimum of response time) would be scheduled to AsyncMedium while long running deferred tasks (such as filecopy) would run in AsyncLow or Background. eSchedulingMode.Background (=15): Tasks in this mode are fed with the resources which remain to the system after otherwise priorized tasks are done. This is intended for longrunning work which has no time constraints for latency or termination. Triggering on external events: Various PLCs allow to schedule the execution of tasks synchronous to certain external events. It depends on the hardware which events are supported. An additional enumeration eSchedulingModeEvent is provided via the device description. The values from this enumeration may be safely inserted when eSchedulingMode is expected.

Mode for File-Seek

Function Description

When a positioning ( Seek() ) is performed within a file, you have to specify the reference index for positioning the new write pointer.

Caveat: When eSeekMode.fromEnd is applied, the corresponing positioning value will typically carry a negative value (unless the desired position is beyound the end of the file). In mode fromActualPosition both negative and positive values are common.

Function Description

This struct is a direct paraphrasis of SysTimeRtc.SYSTIMEDATE , because that struct is defined abiguously between different library versions and thus is not usable as base structure.

Here we have taken the original definitions as temporary replacement for the original structure (which is defined in SysTimeRtc) until this issue is solved.

Use this type in new code rather than SysTimeRtc.SYSTIMEDATE .

Information about a timezone.

Function Description

For obtaining the local time with respect to this time zone, this offset (in minutes) has to be added to the GMT value.

This iOffset corresponds directly to the value which is given e.g. in GMT+0100 for central european time (1 hour + 0 minutes = 60 minutes).

This letter serves for differenciating daylight-saving-time from standard-time within the same time zone.

The most common letters are ‚ÄòS‚Äô = Standard time and ‚ÄòD‚Äô = Daylight-saving-Time. Nevertheless, also other letters may used here for certain peculier local time zone modes. It is depending on the timezone settings, which letters apply here.

This letter is needed only for display purposes rather than for calculations, because the component iOffset is also set to different values in ST and in DST.
