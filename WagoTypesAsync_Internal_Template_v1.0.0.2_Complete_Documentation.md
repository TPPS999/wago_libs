WagoTypesCommon

This is a template for generating device specific versions of this library.

It is itended to be used as default setting for placeholder resolution in libraries only. It MUST NOT be employed in real productive projects.

## SchedulingMode (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | SchedulingMode | eSchedulingMode |  |
| Input | eEvent | eSchedulingModeEvent | device specific scheduling mode |

```
VAR
   eSchedMode := eSchedulingMode; // regular scheduling mode from WagoTypesCommon.library
END_VAR

eSchedMode := SchedulingMode(eSchedulingModeEvent.Modbus_Watchdog_Expired);  // Device specific mode
eSchedMode := eSchedulingMode.Background;                                    // Regular mode
```

```
eSchedMode := eSchedulingModeEvent.Modbus_Watchdog_Expired;  // Device specific mode
```

Casts a device specific scheduling mode into a generic scheduling mode.

Note: Technically, the direct assignment

would also work as intended, but it would produce a warning message. This warning is avoided by using this typecasting function.

Interface variables Casts a device specific scheduling mode into a generic scheduling mode. Usage: Note: Technically, the direct assignment would also work as intended, but it would produce a warning message. This warning is avoided by using this typecasting function.

## SchedulingMode_EventPriority (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | SchedulingMode_EventPriority | eSchedulingMode |  |
| Input | eEvent | eSchedulingModeEvent | device specific event id |
| ePrio | eSchedulingMode | desired priority |

```
VAR
   eSchedMode := eSchedulingMode; // regular scheduling mode from WagoTypesCommon.library
END_VAR

eSchedMode := SchedulingMode_EventPriority(eSchedulingModeEvent.Modbus_Watchdog_Expired,
                                           eSchedulingMode.Background);
```

Casts a device specific scheduling mode into a generic scheduling mode.

In extension to the type-casting function SchedulingMode() , this one allows for specification of an additional priority.

### Global Variable Lists


## AsyncInternalConst (GVL)


| Scope | Name | Type | Initial | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constant | EventModePitch | eSchedulingMode | 16#40 |  |
| PrioritySchedMask | DWORD | 16#3F |  |
| EventSchedMask | DWORD | 16#FFFFFFC0 |  |
| LowestFreeRunning | eSchedulingMode | eSchedulingMode.RealTimeHigh | 1 |
| HighestFreeRunning | eSchedulingMode | eSchedulingMode.Background | 15 |

Specific constants for number ranges.

Attention: when defining new priorities, the upper two values of the range [0..PrioritySchedMask] MUST NOT be used because those values are reserved for special purposes.

(In this case ths would be 16#3E and 16#3F.)

For attaching tasks to specific events.

These events are an extension to eSchedulingMode. Wherever a eSchedulingMode is expected, one of the modes enumerated below can also be used.

Note: To avoid warnings about the enumeration type, a type casing function SchedulingMode() or SchedulingMode_EventPriority() should be involved:

These type casting functions are also provided by this library.
