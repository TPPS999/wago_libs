| xWeatherstationWSC11 | BOOL |  | Set Weatherstation WSC11 for readdressing |
| bOld_Address | BYTE |  | Old address of the sensor. If you don‚Äôt know the old address try ‚Äú0‚Äù for broadcast. |
| bNew_Address | BYTE |  | New address of the sensor if address change was completed |

| sStatus | STRING |  | Status description as string |
| xError | BOOL |  | Signals for 5 seconds a detected error. |
| Inout | xStartAddressChange | BOOL |  | Start addressing. It is reset after readressing is complete. |

You should always call this FB cyclic.

Only one input can be set between the ‚ÄòxClimaSensorUS‚Äô, ‚ÄòxPyranometerGSM‚Äô and ‚ÄòxWeatherstationWSC11‚Äô inputs. If more than one of these inputs is set, the module outputs a tip at the ‚ÄòstStatus‚Äô output and points to an error at the ‚ÄòxError‚Äô output.

If you want to operate a Pyranometer GSM and Compact WSC 11 weather station on a Modbus line with the same address, the sensors can only be readdressed if one of the sensors is disconnected from the bus.
