Wraps The SQLite3 Prepared Statement Object

An instance of this object represents a single SQL statement that has been compiled into binary form and is ready to be evaluated.

Think of each SQL statement as a separate computer program. The original SQL text is source code. A prepared statement object is the compiled object code. All SQL must be converted into a prepared statement before it can be run.

The life-cycle of a prepared statement object usually goes like this:

Think of each SQL statement as a separate computer program. The original SQL text is source code. A prepared statement object is the compiled object code. All SQL must be converted into a prepared statement before it can be run. The life-cycle of a prepared statement object usually goes like this: 1. Create the prepared statement object using FuSqlite3_Prepare() . 2. Bind values to parameters using the FuSqlite3_Bind_*() interfaces. 3. Run the SQL by calling FuSqlite3_Step() one or more times. 4. Reset the prepared statement using FuSqlite3_Reset() then go back to step 2. Do this zero or more times. 5. Destroy the object using FuSqlite3_Finalize() .
