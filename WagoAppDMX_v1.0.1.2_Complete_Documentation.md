The FbDmxMaster function block transmits values to a DMX line. Communication takes place via an RS-485 interface module (750-652). This function block may be used only once per installed serial I/O module.

The DMX function is only possible using WAGO 750-652 Serial Module from firmware version 03. For FW 03 until FW05, maximum 21 or 45 DMX channel can be sent depends on the Process Image setting of the module. From FW 06 maximum 512 DMX channel can be sent.

The FbDmxSlave function block serves to receive values from a DMX line. Communication takes place via an RS-485 interface module (750-652). This function block may be used only once per installed serial I/O module.

The DMX function is only possible using WAGO 750-652 Serial Module from firmware version (06). Maximum 21 DMX value can be read.

The starting channel uiStartChannel must be similar with the configuration of the serial I/O module. The serial I/O module can be configured with WAGO-I/O-CHECK. Including the starting channel number, up to 21 consecutive channels can be read.

Function description

bPortDmx must be connect to the other functions. I_Port must be connected with the serial interface for example: IoConfig_Globals.RS232_485_Interface

The input iStartChannel specifies the first read DMX channel. This starting channel must be similar with the configuration of the serial I/O module. The serial I/O module can be configured with WAGO-I/O-CHECK. Including the starting channel number, up to 21 consecutive channels can be read. The DMX values are read out starting from the start index specified at the iStartChannel input. Please note that the value at the iStartChannel input does not lead to configuration of the start channel number of the serial I/O module. The start channel number must be executed with WAGO-I/O-CHECK.
