This method set the decoder scheme for time signal reception. See the manual for further information.

Possible values for â€˜bAntennaâ€™

You have to connect the input parameter xTrigger with an own bool variable. To transmit the value from bAntenna to the module you have to set the variable at xTrigger once to TRUE. If the method has delivered the value then the variable is set to FALSE by the method.

On setting the time zone and summer time using different antennas.

Possible values for â€˜bAntennaâ€™ You have to connect the input parameter xTrigger with an own bool variable. To transmit the value from bAntenna to the module you have to set the variable at xTrigger once to TRUE. If the method has delivered the value then the variable is set to FALSE by the method. Note On setting the time zone and summer time using different antennas. - The DCF77 transmitter sends CET (Central European Time) or CEST (Central European Summer Time), the summer time setting (DstBias) remains set to zero. The time zone for Germany is 0. - The WWVB transmitter sends in UTC. If the module is operated at the US east coast (Eastern Time) for example, an offset of 5 hours (0xFFFFB9B0) must be entered in the TimeZone. The transition from winter time to summer time is done using a status bit within the time telegram. By setting this bit, one more hour will be transmitted by the module. Within the module, the transition is always performed at 00:00.
