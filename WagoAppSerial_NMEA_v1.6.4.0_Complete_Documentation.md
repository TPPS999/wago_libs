NMEA - Receiver for receiving all NMEA-Sentences and send all given sentences. This FB contains the basic functionality for sending and receiving NMEA sentences. You have to call this function block once for each cycle in your project to process the common functionality.

To get sentences from all the internal received sentences this FB provides two methods (see FbNmeaSubscriber.GetFilteredSentence and FbNmeaSubscriber.GetEachSentence )

For sending any sentence it will supported by the method FbNmeaSubscriber.WriteSentence

You should always call this FB cyclic.
