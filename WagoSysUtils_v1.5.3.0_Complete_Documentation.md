### Methods


## FbExclusivityHandler.AttachExclusively (METH)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | AttachExclusively | eResultCode |  |
| Input | RequestorID | WagoClientIdentification | address of the instance which wants to use the device exclusively |

| result codes |
| 0 | success, exclusive usage is granted |
| EBUSY | Usage is not granted. The device has been attached to another user already |
| EINVAL | Null instance is passed. (Null denotes a detached device) |

Tries to get grant of exclusive acces to the device.

Note (1): This mechanism provides a means for cooperatively using specific devices. However, It does not implement mechanisms for enforcing that policy.

Note (2): It seems suitable to pass the address of the attached high-level-FB as unique identification tag for the client which uses the device. The divece, however does not use any knowledge about those high-level-FBs, so virtually any unique number may be passed here.
