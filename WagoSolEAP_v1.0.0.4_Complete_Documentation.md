Function block to communicate with a EAP-RBG1 room operating unit.

Graphical Illustration

Function description

Function block to communicate with a EAP-RBG1 slave. For each slave one of those funktion block is needed.

The FbRBG1 reads the data from the EAP room control device. A continuous TRUE signal at the xEnable input activates the readout process, and a FALSE signal deactivates it. If the input is not enabled, the output process starts automatically. The function block is synchronized with the communication module (FbEAP_MasterRTU) via the bPortEAP input. The device address is specified at the bSlaveAddress input. By assigning different addresses, you can address multiple devices via one serial I/O module. This input is assigned 1 by default. dtActualTime is used for displaying the date and time on the RBG1. Displaying the current fan stage requires writing to bActualValueFan.

If the inputs xSetSetpointFan_In and xSetSetpointTemp_In are TRUE, the setpoint values rSetpointFan_In and rSetpointTemp_In will override the setpoint values rSetpointFan_Out and rSetpointTemp_ Out on the RBG1. For example to reset the setpoint to a basic setting.

Each of the typMessage1 and typMessage2 structures can be used to display its own text (24 characters) with a freely selectable background color on the RBG1. eSymbol can be used to display specify a symbol that indicates the current room status.

The RBG1 configuration is stored in the typConfigRBG1 structure and should therefore be declared RETAIN PERSISTENT in the program. To identify an error, the current error code is displayed at the output eMB_Error . The enumMBerror enumeration is found in Modb_I05.lib. The current room temperature and humidity values are output on the rRoomTemperature and rRoomHumidity outputs. The setpoints for the target temperature and target fan stage that were set via the RBG1 are output on the rSetpointTemp_Out and rSetpointFan_Out outputs. xButton1 â€“ xButton8 indicate whether a button is pressed on the RBG1. typDeviceInfoRBG1 outputs the current version information of the RBG1.
