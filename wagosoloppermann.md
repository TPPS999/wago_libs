## Core Function Blocks

### Fb_PPX
The function block reads out the data from the Oppermann differential pressure monitor *SENSO-X PPX*.

**Description:**
A permanent TRUE signal at the input ``xEnable`` enables the readout process and a FALSE signal disables it. If the input is not enabled, the readout process starts automatically. The device address is specified at the input ``bSlaveAddress``. By assigning different addresses, multiple devices can be addressed via one serial I/O module. This input is preset with ``1`` by default. The minimum interval time to be maintained for readouts is determined at the input ``tCycleTime``. The actual time between the readouts can be greater depending on the number of instantiated readout modules on one MODBUS line. As default, no time is set; this ensures operation is as fast as possible. The data that is read out is provided in a structure at the output ``typStatus_PPX``. The structure contains the following parameters: - ``.wPressure`` indicates measured differential pressure in Pa. - ``.wLimit`` indicates the limit value in Pa. - ``.xAnalogOutput`` indicates the status of analog output. - ``.wRange`` indicates the working range in Pa. - ``.bUnit`` indicates the configured unit. - ``.rTemperature`` indicates the temperature on circuit board in °C. - ``.rAirPressure`` indicates the absolute air pressure inside case in hPa. - ``.xSensorError`` indicates the error status of sensor. - ``.bMeasuredLimit`` indicates the measured limit in %. - ``.xDigitalOutput`` indicates the status of digital output. - ``.bLED`` indicates the status of the LED. - ``.wFirmwareVersion`` indicates the firmware version of the device. - ``.bType`` indicates the device type.
