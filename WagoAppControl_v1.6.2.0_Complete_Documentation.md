This Fb provides control about starting, stoppping, and resetting of other applications.

Function Description

For operation, the FB is attached to the desired application with the method AttachToApplication() .

Once the Fb is successfully attached to the controlled application, this application may be started, stopped or reset by the corresponding methods.

The output â€˜xBusyâ€™ indicates that certain asynchronous operations (e.g. stop()) are still pending and that the desired state has not yet been reached. When the state of the application has reached its target state, xBusy will return to FALSE again.

Typical usage:

Note: Generally speaking, this FB also works on the same application where the fb is embedded. But keep in mind that once an application has stopped itself, it will have some difficulties re-starting itself again.

## FbWagoPlcOperationControl (FB)


Temporarily disabling critical PLC operations.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

This FB provides means for temporarily preventing the PLC from being stopped, written to or being otherwise manipulated by external means.

Additionaly to the fundamental functiatity, a pair of Enter()/Leave() methods is provided (see: â€˜Critical Sectionsâ€™ below): EnterSection() stores the state of the PLC-Flags internally, before setting new states according its argument. Finally, LeaveSection() restores these flags again, so the application does not have to restore them explicitly.

## doc10_Overview (FB)


This library provides means for controlling the operation of applications, (e.g. starting and stopping, etc.) from another application or from the application itself.

Secondly, means are provided for temporarily disabling critical operations from the codesys-IDE in critical sections.

### Methods


## FbWagoApplicationControl.AttachToApplication (METH)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | AttachToApplication | eResultCode |  |
| Input | sName | STRING | name of the application. |

| Result Codes |
| 0 | Success |
| ENOENT | An application with the given name does not exist |

Attaches the FB to a named application.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

An empty string denotes this application, i.e. the application which issues the call.

Interface variables Function Attaches the FB to a named application. Graphical Illustration ![Image](images/wagoappcontrol_e6c59fed.png) Function Description An empty string denotes this application, i.e. the application which issues the call.

## FbWagoApplicationControl.Detach (METH)


| Scope | Name | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 0 | Success |

Releases the control

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

Interface variables Function Releases the control Graphical Illustration ![Image](images/wagoappcontrol_9fed81a9.png) Function Description Note (1): Technically, the use of Detach() is neither mandatory nor strictly needed. However, it is good practice to use Detach(), because in this case subsequent calls of StopApplication() etc. would not stop any application which has been attached previously but whos attachment is obsolete now. Note (2): This method never fails (always returns OK), because there is no interaction with any previously attached applications.

Disables a set of certain PLC operations.

Graphical Illustration

Function Description

Before disabling the referred operations this method stores the previous state internally. Later, the stored state will be effective again after the corresponding LeaveSection() method has been called.

The set of PLC operations which were allowed before this call becomes effective is provided as the return value of this method.

There is no nesting implemented for this method pair. When EnterSection() is called successively without calling LeaveSection() inbetween, further PLC operations may be disabled by these calls. The next LeaveSection() will restore the state from before the first EnterSection() call was issued. Only one LeaveSection() is needed for a series on EnterSections().

Note (1): As a consequence of this, if EnterSection() is called when the program flow has already entered a section (and not left it again), the returned value is not necessarily the state which will be restored with LeaveSection() .

Note(2): The addressed properties are only disabled by this call. If they are not addressed here, the will not be automatically enabled, but they are left in their current state.

Function Description

The values are intended to be superimposed in a way like like:

When a bit is set in a variable of this type, the corresponding feature is disabled .

The value All is a magic value for setting all available disable-flags whatever they are. It will not be returned by EnterSection() when every possible feature is disabled. At that point only those bits are returned, which are actually known and regarded by this library. Other bits are not considered here.
