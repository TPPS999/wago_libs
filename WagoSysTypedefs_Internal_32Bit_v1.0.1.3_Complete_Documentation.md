### Functions


## Dint_to_Pointer (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | Dint_to_Pointer | POINTER TO BYTE |  |
| Input | di | DINT | the pointer which is to be typecasted |

converts a POINTER into an unsigned double integer without throwing warnings.

Note: When this function is needed, it mostly indicates a principal design flaw of the POUs which require its usage. Nevertheless, in some situations we encounter some functions in external libraries, where things are completely messed up, e.g. in SysFile, where a file handle is once declared as Pointer in Open() and in the same context SysFileGetSizeByHandle() expects a UDINT as handle.

Release Note

Interface variables WagoSysTypedefs-Internal - 32Bit Overview This library deals with some few pointer issues, which are target specific, mainly: - conversion from pointers to udints. This is necessary in many system calls where both types are assumed to be 32 bit and mixed together in a rather non-uniform and obscure manner. This mixing often leads to compiler warnings. Those are avoided by introducing a type conversion function Pointer_To_Udint() from this libraray. Release Note - This library is supposed to work only on 32-Bit systems, not on 64-Bit systems. - Normally, the compiler should do all the work of this library without introducing the overhead of a function call in the middle. (Indeed it does so, but it throws warnings, which may obscure other warnings.) - When resolved by placeholders from the device description (in 32-bit systems only), this lib provide a save way of mixing pointers and udints.

## Pointer_To_Udint (FUN)


| Scope | Name | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Return | Pointer_To_Udint | UDINT |  |
| Input | p | POINTER TO BYTE | the pointer which is to be typecasted |

converts a POINTER into an unsigned double integer without throwing warnings.

Note: When this function is needed, it mostly indicates a principal design flaw of the POUs which require its usage. Nevertheless, in some situations we encounter some functions in external libraries, where things are completely messed up, e.g. in SysFile, where a file handle is once declared as Pointer in Open() and in the same context SysFileGetSizeByHandle() expects a UDINT as handle.
