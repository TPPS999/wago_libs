## Core Function Blocks

### FbDPT_HVACMode_pro
This function block is used for data exchange with a KNX object of format N3N5r2N6r2N6 (|doc10_DPT_Notations_and_Format|) Each function block represents a KNX DPT (Data Point Type) and appears in the ETS later as a communication object. The DPT function blocks are addressed by numbering at the ``dwIndex_DPT`` input. The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` This function block can read the actual value of KNX and it is possible to set a minimal time between two telegrams. .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``bValue_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter ``tMinSendTime``. The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced with frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``bValue_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

### FbDPT_Step_pro
This function block is used for data exchange with a KNX object of format B1 (|doc10_DPT_Notations_and_Format|) Each function block represents a KNX DPT (Data Point Type) and appears in the ETS later as a communication object. The DPT function blocks are addressed by numbering at the ``dwIndex_DPT`` input. The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` The difference to ``FbDPT_Step`` is that this function block can read the actual value of KNX and it is possible to set a minimal time between two telegrams. .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``xSwitch_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. If the input signal ``xControl_IN`` is also set, the output telegram is sent by prompting. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter ``tMinSendTime``. The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced with frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``xSwitch_OUT`` output. Prompting is active when the ``xControl_OUT`` output is set. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The ``xSwitch_OUT`` output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``bValue_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter ``tMinSendTime``. The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced with frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``bValue_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced with frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``diValue_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

### FbDPT_Value_Wsp
This function block is used for data exchange with a KNX object of format F16 (|doc10_DPT_Notations_and_Format|) Each function block represents a KNX DPT (Data Point Type) and appears in the ETS later as a communication object. The DPT function blocks are addressed by numbering at the ``dwIndex_DPT`` input. The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``rValue_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The parameter ``rSendOnDelta`` indicates the amount by which the input value ``rValue_IN`` must change before an update is initiated within the network. The sending frequency can be limited in this manner. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``rValue_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``rValue_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The parameter ``rSendOnDelta`` indicates the amount by which the input value ``rValue_IN`` must change before an update is initiated within the network. The sending frequency can be limited in this manner. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``rValue_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

This function block is used for data exchange with a KNX object of format V16 (|doc10_DPT_Notations_and_Format|) Each function block represents a KNX DPT (Data Point Type) and appears in the ETS later as a communication object. The DPT function blocks are addressed by numbering at the ``dwIndex_DPT`` input. The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` The difference to ``FbDPT_DeltaTime10Msec`` is that this function block can read the actual value of KNX and it is possible to set a minimal time between two telegrams. .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``iValue_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The parameter ``bSendOnDelta`` indicates the amount by which the input value ``iValue_IN`` must change before an update is initiated within the network. The sending frequency can be limited in this manner. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter ``tMinSendTime``. The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced with frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``iValue_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` The difference to ``FbDPT_TimePeriod100Msec`` is that this function block can read the actual value of KNX and it is possible to set a minimal time between two telegrams. .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``wValue_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The parameter ``wSendOnDelta`` indicates the amount by which the input value ``wValue_IN`` must change before an update is initiated within the network. The sending frequency can be limited in this manner. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter ``tMinSendTime``. The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced with frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``wValue_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` This function block can read the actual value of KNX and it is possible to set a minimal time between two telegrams. .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input "bIN" causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the "xUpdate_KNX" input. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter "tMinSendTime". The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced by frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the "xRead_KNX" input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the "bOUT" output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a "typDPT" IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The output values "abOUT" are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output "xUpdate_PLC". The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output "xTimeOut".

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``rValue_IN`` or ``bValue_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The parameter ``rSendOnDelta`` or ``bSendOnDelta`` indicates the amount by which the input value ``rValue_IN`` must change before an update is initiated within the network. The sending frequency can be limited in this manner. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter ``tMinSendTime``. The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced by frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address.

Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``xSwitch_OUT`` output. Prompting is active when the ``xControl_OUT`` output is set. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The ``xSwitch_OUT`` output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.

### FbDPT_UpDown
This function block is used for data exchange with a KNX object of format B1 (|doc10_DPT_Notations_and_Format|) Each function block represents a KNX DPT (Data Point Type) and appears in the ETS later as a communication object. The DPT function blocks are addressed by numbering at the ``dwIndex_DPT`` input. The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``xSwitch_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``xSwitch_OUT`` output. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The ``xSwitch_OUT`` output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle.

### FbDPT_Switch
This function block is used for data exchange with a KNX object of format B1 (|doc10_DPT_Notations_and_Format|) Each function block represents a KNX DPT (Data Point Type) and appears in the ETS later as a communication object. The DPT function blocks are addressed by numbering at the ``dwIndex_DPT`` input. The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle.

### FbKNX_Master
**Description:**
This function block detects all queued commands of the other KNX function blocks in the program and initiates their execution. ``bPortKNX`` must be connect to the other function blocks. ``I_Port`` must be connected with the serial interface for example: ``IoConfig_Globals.KNX_EIB_TP1_Interface`` .. note:: This function block may be used only once per KNX module 753-646.

### FbDPT_Bool_pro
This function block is used for data exchange with a KNX object of format B1 (|doc10_DPT_Notations_and_Format|) Each function block represents a KNX DPT (Data Point Type) and appears in the ETS later as a communication object. The DPT function blocks are addressed by numbering at the ``dwIndex_DPT`` input. The instance names are given a specific prefix that is structured as follows :ref:`prefix of instance name <doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name>` The difference to ``FbDPT_Bool`` is that this function block can read the actual value of KNX and it is possible to set a minimal time between two telegrams. .. note:: It is not verified that the prefix of the instance name (see |doc20_Prefix_of_DPT_Instance_Name|) matches the function block assignment at input ``dwIndex_DPT``. If they do not match, inconsistent data is generated.

**Description:**
The function block can be used either for sending or receiving object values. ``bPortKNX`` gets the same number as the KNX master has on ``bPortKNX``. Sending: A value change at input ``xSwitch_IN`` causes a telegram to be transmitted to the KNX module/controller. If the input signal ``xControl_IN`` is also set, the output telegram is sent by prompting. Sending can also be forced by a rising edge present at the ``xUpdate_KNX`` input. The minimum time interval for sending telegrams can be defined for the function block using the parameter ``tMinSendTime``. The volume of telegram traffic can be reduced with frequently changing signals. A rising edge at the ``xRead_KNX`` input causes a read telegram to be triggered by the transmitting group address. Receiving: If the function block is used for receiving data (output), the data received from the module/controller is signaled at the ``xSwitch_OUT`` output. Prompting is active when the ``xControl_OUT`` output is set. The non-scaled values for the received data are provided as a ``typDPT`` IN_OUT variable. This offers the user the possibility of also saving the values as a RETAIN variable, allowing the output values to be retained after a controller reset. The ``xSwitch_OUT`` output values are also retained after resetting the controller. A telegram update, initiated by a KNX group address, is signaled at output ``xUpdate_PLC``. The variable will then switch to TRUE for one program cycle. With timeout monitoring activated for a KNX object (KNX plug-in setting), violation (exceeding) of the monitoring time is indicated by a signal at output ``xTimeOut``.
