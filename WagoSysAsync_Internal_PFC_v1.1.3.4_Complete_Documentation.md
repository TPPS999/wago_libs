Returns a handle to an JobInfo structure of an anynchronized thread.

On successful operation, ^pResult is always set to 0, ^pudState is set to ASYNCSTATE_PENDING (=0) and the returned handle is valid.

| Return | Remove | eResultCode |

| 0=OK | Success. |
| EBADF | The Job handle is invalid. |
| EPIPE | The handle does not longer refer to a valid job (broken connection). |
| EBUSY | The One-Shot-Job is active and thus will not be attempted to be removed. |
| EPENDING | The daemon job is currently running and will be removed after it has finished. |
| ECODESYS+X | CoDeSys-specific fault (not specified). |

Removes scheduled job and terminates daemons.

This method exhibits different behaviour for one-shot-jobs and daemons:

One-Shot-Jobs:

The method removes the job from the list after the job has terminated. It should not be called before that time, because an active job cannt be killed or removed. When called while the job is still active, remove() returns EPENDING.

This method stops the re-scheduling of daemons and removes them afterwards. If the daemon is currently executed, remove() delivers EPENDING instead of OK, which is not an error. During the remaining run-time of the runner, the job state is ECANCELED. After termination of the runner, no additional remove() is necessary.

If the Fb state indicates that the deferred job is in an invalid state or that the handle has a non-proper value, this method returns immediately EPIPE or EBADF respectively without trying to romove anything.

Schedules the runner as a daemon.

A daemon is a job in the background which is periodically re-scheduled for execution after it has terminated.

As a consequence, the runner of a daemon SHOULD consume considerably less execution time than its periodicity intervall, because it would otherwise block other daemons. This restriction escpecially includes blocking system calls (such as socket-connect(), e.g.). This is in contrast to regular one-shot jobs, which are deferred as a background job just because they are long-running or blocking.

Note: This restriction is planned to be lifted when the thread-pool is implemented, which would prevent different jobs from blocking each other.

Thus, the points in placing daemons are

and not primarily deferring long-running sequences away from the main task.

Scheduling:

A daemon may either be deferred to another cyclic task according to one of the scheduling modes eSchedulingMode.Background .. eSchedulingMode.RealTimeHigh .

Or alternatively it may be synchronized to an external event, which is indicated by a slightly different but compatible enumeration. In that case, the type-casing wrapper SchedulingMode() has to be employed, e.g. :

If the target hardware supports it, also a combination of both modes defined if the target hardware supports that. In this case a different wrapper is required:

Runner Result:

Like in all other scheduling modes the method getRunnerResult() delivers the result code of the most recent execution of the runner. In contrast to one-shot-jobs, this result is updated periodically in each daemon-cycle and it thus might change asynchronously. Consequently, it is not provided as generic output, but it may be used by derived FBs.

| Scope | Name | Type | Initial | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constant | ASYNCJOB_INVALID_HANDLE | RTS_IEC_HANDLE | RTS_INVALID_HANDLE | nominally not valid handle |
| ASYNCSTATE_INVALID | UDINT | 16#FFFFFFFF | can be as default value, will never be written |
| ASYNC_TIMEOUT_INFINITE | UDINT | 0 | no timeout |
| ASYNC_IS_IEC | UDINT | 1 | marker for IEC jobs |
| ASYNC_ISNOT_IEC | UDINT | 0 | marker for generic C-jobs. |
| ASYNCSTATE_PENDING | UDINT | 0 | job is in the list but not yet executed |
| ASYNCSTATE_ACTIVE | UDINT | 1 | the job is currently beeing executed |
| ASYNCSTATE_READY | UDINT | 2 | the job is finished |
| ASYNCSTATE_ERROR | UDINT | 3 | an exception has occurred during execution (terminated automatically) |
| ASYNCSTATE_TIMEOUT | UDINT | 4 | job has not been activated due to previous timeout |

Job parameters for TscAsyncAddJob()

bDeamon : if true, async-job is handled like a deamon. To stop/remove the deamon call TscAsyncRemove()

InOut: Job parameters for TscAsyncAddJob() ulJobPriority : external triggered jobs have always the IEC-Priority 0 in actual firmware-releases. non external jobs could have IEC-Priorities 1,2,3,4,7,14,15 like Sched-Modes in WagoSysAsync pszExtEvtName : name of the external event, that triggers the async-job. actually only localbus-events supported bDeamon : if true, async-job is handled like a deamon. To stop/remove the deamon call TscAsyncRemove()
